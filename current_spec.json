A rational analysis should be used to determine the number of floors \nto be shored, reshored, or backshored, subject to the minimums stated in the following \nparagraph, and to determine the loads transmitted to the floors, shores and reshores or \nbackshores as a result of the construction sequence.  The analysis should consider, but \nshould not necessarily be limited to, the following: \n1. \nStructural design load of the slab or member including live load, partition loads, \nand other loads for which the engineer designed the slab. The live load reduction \nmethod for the design of certain members is shown on the structural drawings. \nThe reduced live load and an allowance for construction loads shall be taken into \nconsideration when performing the analysis. \n2. \nDead load weight of the concrete and formwork. \n3. \nConstruction live loads, such as placing crews and equipment or stored \nmaterials. \n4. \nDesign strength of concrete specified. \n5. \nCycle time between placement of successive floors. \n6. \nStrength of concrete at time it is required to support shoring loads from above. \n7. \nThe distribution of loads between floors, shores, and reshores or backshores at \nthe time of placing concrete, stripping formwork, and removal of reshoring or \nbackshoring. \n8. \nSpan of slab or structural member between permanent supports. \n9. \nType of formwork systems, i.e., span of horizontal formwork components, \nindividual shore loads, etc. \n10. \nMinimum age of concrete where appropriate. \n11. \nAlignment of shores:  Where possible, shores for any floor shall be placed \ndirectly above previously placed shores so that load will be transferred directly to \nsuch shores.  Where shores are not vertically aligned, calculations shall include \nverification that the structure can support the reaction. \n3.6 \nREMOVAL OF FORMS AND SUPPORTS \nA. \nDetermination by Contractor's Registered Engineer:  The Contractor's registered \nprofessional engineer shall determine and submit for Owner's record the time and \nsequence of formwork and shore removal subject to the criteria as specified below.  The \nsubmittal shall clearly distinguish between reshoring and backshoring procedures. \nB. \nDetermining in situ Strength of Concrete:  The General Contractor shall be responsible \nfor making and curing concrete cylinders, cured under field conditions, for the purpose of \ndetermining concrete strength at time of form and shore removal.  Such cylinders shall be \nmade by the Contractor and tested by his testing laboratory.  Alternatively, the in situ \nstrength of concrete may be determined by the Maturity Method following the \nrequirements of ASTM C 1074.  An acceptable system for this method is the \u201cintelliRock\u201d \nsystem manufactured and supplied by Engius Constructive Intelligence of Stillwater, OK. \nC. \nRecords of Weather Conditions:  The Contractor shall be responsible for keeping records \nof weather conditions to be used in the decision on when to remove forms. \nD. \nFormwork Not Supporting Concrete:  Formwork not supporting concrete, such as sides of \nbeams, walls, columns and similar parts of the structure, may be removed after \ncumulatively (not necessarily consecutively) curing at not less than 50\u00b0F for 12 hours \nafter placing concrete, provided the concrete is sufficiently hard so as not to be damaged \nby form removal operations and provided curing and protection operations are \nmaintained.  If ambient air temperatures remain below 50\u00b0F, if retarding agents are used, \n\n \n \nshall be increased as required to safely remove the forms without damage to the \nconcrete.  Where such forms also support formwork for slab or beam soffits, the removal \ntimes of the latter shall govern. \nE. \nFormwork Supporting Weight of Concrete:  Formwork supporting weight of concrete such \nas beam soffits, joists, slabs and other structural elements shall not be removed until \nconcrete has attained at least the following percentages of the design compressive \nstrength: \n1. \nJoists, Beam Bottoms:  70%, but not less than 2,800 psi. \n2. \nSlabs:  70%, but not less than 2,800 psi. \nF. \nPlacing Reshores and Backshores: \n1. \nAll shoring operations shall be carried out in accordance with a planned \nsequence as determined by the Contractor's shoring engineer. \n2. \nShoring operations shall be performed so that at no time will areas of new \nconstruction be required to support combined dead and construction loads in \nexcess of the available strength as determined by the design loads (as specified \nin the General Notes) and the developed concrete strength (as determined by \nfield cured cylinders or maturity method) at the time of stripping and reshoring or \nbackshoring. \n3. \nShores (backshores or reshores) shall not be removed until the structural \nmember supported has sufficient strength to support all applied loads. \n4. \nFor backshoring operations, the forms shall be removed in such a manner that \nindividual structural members are not allowed to deflect and carry load. \n5. \nReshoring operations require that the structural members be strong enough to \nsafely support their own weight before stripping of formwork. \n6. \nFor reshoring operations, no structural member shall be overstressed under its \nown dead weight plus the weight of the floors above and construction loads \nassigned to the structural member by a rational analysis that accounts for the \nrelative stiffness of each floor with due consideration of concrete age and \nstrength.  While reshoring is underway, no construction loads shall be permitted \non the new construction unless it can safely support the construction loads. \n7. \nWhere possible, shores shall be located in the same position on each floor so \nthat they will be continuous in their support from floor to floor. \n3.7 \nFIELD QUALITY CONTROL \nA. \nField Inspection:  Refer to Specification 01 45 29 \u201cStructural Testing and Inspections\u201d for \ninspection requirements associated with forming and accessories. \n \n END OF SECTION  \nNEW SECTION STARTS HERE", "UNKNOWN 5": "\n\n \n \n \nCONCRETE REINFORCING \nPART 1 GENERAL \n1.1 \nRELATED DOCUMENTS \nA. \nDrawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary \nConditions and Division 01 Specification sections, apply to work of this section. \n1.2 \nSUMMARY \nA. \nSection includes labor, materials, hardware, equipment, transportation and services \nrequired to fabricate and place all reinforcement for cast-in-place concrete including bars, \nwelded wire reinforcement, ties and supports shown on the drawings and as specified.   \nB. \nRelated Requirements: \n1. \nSpecification 01 45 29 \u201cStructural Testing and Inspections\u201d for testing and \ninspection requirements associated with concrete reinforcing. \n2. \nSpecification 03 10 00 \u201cConcrete Forming and Accessories\u201d for forming \nassociated with cast-in-place concrete. \n3. \nSpecification 03 30 00 \u201cCast-in-Place Concrete\u201d for cast-in-place concrete and \nrelated products. \n1.3 \nPRICE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES \nA. \nAlternates: \n1. \nProducts Requiring International Code Council (ICC) Evaluation Service Reports: \na. \nFor those products listed in Part 2 as requiring Evaluation Service \nReports (ESRs), alternate products that do not have ESRs will be \nconsidered by the Engineer only if valid research reports or test data \nfrom an independent and approved agency is provided and use of the \nproduct receives prior approval from the Building Official. \n1.4 \nREFERENCES \nA. \nReference Standards: \n1. \nComply with all provisions of the following codes, specifications, and standards \nexcept where more stringent requirements are shown or specified: \na. \nACI 117, \u201cSpecifications for Tolerances for Concrete Construction and \nMaterials.\" \nb. \nACI 301, \"Specifications for Structural Concrete for Buildings.\" \nc. \nANSI/AWS D1.4, \u201cStructural Welding Code \u2013 Reinforcing Steel.\u201d \nd. \nCRSI, \"Manual of Standard Practice.\" \n1.5 \nADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS \nA. \nCoordination: \n1. \nQuality Control:  The Contractor is responsible for quality control, including \nworkmanship and materials furnished by subcontractors and suppliers. \n\n \n \n \n2. \nDocument Conflict and Precedence:  In case of conflict among documents, \nincluding architectural and structural drawings and specifications, notify the \nArchitect/Engineer prior to submitting proposal.

Offset joints in girders a minimum distance of \ntwice the beam width from a beam-girder intersection.  Place joints perpendicular \nto main reinforcement.  Continue reinforcement across construction joints unless \notherwise shown on the drawings.  Dowels that cross construction joints shall be \nsupported during concreting operations so as to remain parallel with the slab or \nwall surface and at right angles to the joint.  Submit all construction joint locations \nas a shop drawing submittal. \n3. \nWaterstops:  Provide waterstops in construction joints as indicated on the \nArchitectural and Structural Drawings.  Install waterstops to form continuous \ndiaphragm in each joint.  Make provisions to support and protect exposed \nwaterstops during progress of work.  Fabricate field joints in waterstops in \naccordance with manufacturer's printed instructions.  Waterstops shall be \ninstalled with a minimum of 3\u201d of concrete cover. \n4. \nIsolation Joints in Slabs-on-Grade:  Construct isolation joints (without dowels) in \nslabs-on-grade at points of contact between slabs-on-grade and vertical surfaces \nonly where specifically detailed on the drawings.  Install joint-filler strips at joints \nwhere indicated.  Extend joint-filler strips full width and depth of joint, terminating \nflush with finished concrete surface, unless otherwise indicated on the drawings.  \nInstall joint-filler strips in lengths as long as practicable.  Where more than one \nlength is required, lace or clip sections together.  Provide construction joints with \ndowels at all locations unless isolation joints are detailed. \nB. \nContraction Joints in Slabs-on-Grade and Unbonded Topping Slabs:  Install contraction \njoints at locations and spacings as indicated on the drawings or if not shown on drawings, \nlocated so as not to impair strength and appearance of the structure, as acceptable to \nArchitect/Engineer.  Maximum joint spacing shall be per the drawings and be \nperpendicular to the slab surface.  Use one of the two following methods (sawed or \nformed) to create the joints.  Do not use the formed joint in areas subject to vehicular \ntraffic or in industrial slabs. \n1. \nSawed Joints: \na. \nPrimary Method:  Early-Entry, dry-cut method, using Soff-Cut saws.  \nFinisher must have documented successful experience in the use of this \nmethod prior to this project.  Install cuts within one to four hours, \ndepending on air temperature, after final finish as soon as the concrete \nsurface is firm enough to not be torn or damaged by the blade at each \nsaw cut location.  Use 1/8 inch thick blade, cutting to a depth of one \nquarter of the slab thickness but not less than one inch.  Cut to a depth \nof one third of the slab thickness for slabs reinforced with steel fibers or \nsynthetic fibers. \nb. \nOptional Method (where Soff-Cut System method equipment is not \navailable, subject to limitations):  This method may not be used when \nthere is no dowel passing through the contraction joint.  Use a \nconventional saw to cut joints within four to 12 hours after finishing as \nsoon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to prevent aggregates \nfrom being dislodged by the saw.  Complete cutting before shrinkage \nstresses become sufficient to produce cracking.  Use 1/8 inch thick \nblade, cutting to a depth of one quarter of the slab thickness but not less \nthan one inch.  Cut to a depth of one third of the slab thickness for slabs \nreinforced with steel fibers. \nC. \nFormed Joints:  Form contraction joints by inserting premolded plastic hardboard or \nfiberboard strip into fresh concrete until top surface of strip is flush with slab surface.  The \n\n \n \n \nedges round on each side of insert.  After concrete has cured, remove inserts and clean \ngroove of loose debris. \nD. \nThe Contractor shall protect the joints from damage caused by wheeled traffic or other \nsources during construction until a joint-filler material (if specified) has been installed. \n3.4 \nINSTALLATION OF EMBEDDED ITEMS \nA. \nGeneral:  Set and build into work anchorage devices and other embedded items required \nfor other work that is attached to, or supported by, cast-in-place concrete.  Use setting \ndrawings, diagrams, instructions and directions provided by suppliers of items to be \nattached thereto unless directed otherwise by these specifications.  Install reglets to \nreceive top edge of foundation sheet waterproofing where specified by the Architect, and \nto receive thru-wall flashings in outer face of concrete frame at exterior walls, where \nflashing is shown at lintels, relieving angles and other conditions. \nB. \nEdge Forms and Screed Strips for Slabs:  Set edge forms or bulkheads and intermediate \nscreed strips for slabs to obtain required elevations and contours in finished slab surface.  \nProvide and secure units sufficiently strong to support types of screed strips by use of \nstrike-off templates or accepted compacting type screeds. \nC. \nDo not install sleeves in any concrete member except where shown on the structural \ndrawings or approved by the Architect and Engineer. \nD. \nSecurely fasten embedded plates, angles, anchor rods and other items to be built into the \nconcrete to the formwork or hold in place with templates.  Insertion of these items into \nconcrete after concrete placement is prohibited. \n3.5 \nCONCRETE PLACEMENT \nA. \nPre-placement Inspection:  Before placing concrete, inspect and complete formwork \ninstallation, reinforcing steel, and items to be embedded or cast-in.  Notify other crafts to \npermit installation of their work; cooperate with other trades in setting such work.  Moisten \nwood forms immediately before placing concrete where form coatings are not used. \nB. \nConcrete Batch Trip Tickets:  The Contractor shall collect and retain concrete batch trip \ntickets.  Compressive strength, slump, air content, and temperature tests shall be \nidentified by reference to a particular trip ticket.  Tickets shall contain the information \nspecified in ASTM C 94.  Each ticket shall also show the amount of water that may be \nadded in the field for the entire batch that will not exceed the specified water cement ratio \nfor the design mixture.  The Contractor and Testing Laboratory shall immediately notify \nthe Architect/Engineer and each other of tickets not meeting the criteria specified. \nC. \nCauses for Rejection of Concrete:  The Contractor shall reject concrete delivered to the \nsite for any of the following reasons: \n1. \nWrong class of concrete (incorrect design mixture number). \n2. \nEnvironmental condition limits shall be as follows unless appropriate provisions in \nconcrete practices have been made for cold or hot weather: \na. \nCold Weather:  Air temperature must be 40\u00b0F and rising or the average \ndaily temperature cannot have been lower than 40\u00b0F for three \nconsecutive days unless the temperature rose about 50\u00b0F for at least \none-half of any of those 24 hour periods. \n\n \n \n \nb. \nHot Weather:  Environmental conditions must be such that cause an \nevaporation rate from the concrete surface of 0.2 pounds per square foot \nper hour or less as determined by the figure \u201cNRMCA Nomograph for \nEstimating Evaporation Rate on the Basis of Menzel Formula\u201d in \nAppendix A of ACI 305.1. \nc. \nConcrete may be placed at other environmental condition ranges only \nwith the approval of the job inspector for the Testing Laboratory or other \nduly appointed representative. \n3. \nConcrete with temperatures exceeding 95\u00b0F. \n4. \nAir contents outside the limits specified in the design mixtures. \n5. \nSlumps outside the limits specified. \n6. \nWater added to the mix that exceeds the maximum allowed water-to-\ncementitious material ratio. \n7. \nExcessive Age:  Concrete shall be discharged within 90 minutes of plant \ndeparture or before it begins to set if sooner than 90 minutes and it shall be \ndischarged before the drum has revolved 300 revolutions, unless approved by \nthe Testing Laboratory job inspector or other duly appointed representative. \nD. \nCoordinate the installation of joint materials and vapor retarders with placement of forms \nand reinforcing steel. \nE. \nComply with ACI 301 and as herein specified: \n1. \nConcrete Temperature: The maximum acceptable concrete temperature at the \ntruck discharge point shall be 95\u00b0F. \n2. \nDeposit concrete continuously or in layers of such thickness that no concrete will \nbe placed on concrete that has hardened sufficiently to cause the formation of \nseams or planes of weakness.  If a section cannot be placed continuously, \nprovide construction joints as herein specified.  Deposit concrete as nearly as \npracticable to its final location to avoid segregation.  Spread concrete using \nshort-handled, square-ended shovels, or come-alongs. \n3. \nPlacing Concrete in Forms:  Deposit concrete in forms in horizontal layers not \ndeeper than 24\" and in a manner to avoid inclined construction joints.  Where \nplacement consists of several layers, place each layer while preceding layer is \nstill plastic to avoid cold joints. \n4. \nConsolidate placed concrete by mechanical vibrating equipment supplemented \nby hand-spading, rodding or tamping.  Use internal vibrators of the largest size \nand power that can properly be used in the work. \n5. \nDo not vibrate Self-Consolidating Concrete. \n6. \nDo not use vibrators to transport concrete inside forms.  Insert and withdraw \nvibrators vertically at uniformly spaced locations not farther than visible \neffectiveness of machine.  Place vibrators to penetrate rapidly placed layer and \nat least 6\" into preceding layer.  Do not insert vibrators into lower layers of \nconcrete that have begun to set.  At each insertion limit duration of vibration to \ntime necessary to consolidate concrete and complete embedment of \nreinforcement and other embedded items without causing segregation of mix. \n7. \nPlacing Concrete Slabs:  Deposit and consolidate concrete slabs in a continuous \noperation, within limits of construction joints, until the placing of a panel or \nsection is completed.  Place concrete for beams, girders, brackets, column \ncapitals, haunches, and drop panels at the same time as concrete for slabs.  Do \nnot place concrete over columns and walls until concrete in columns and walls is \nno longer plastic and has been in place at least one hour. \n8. \nConsolidate concrete during placing operations so that concrete is thoroughly \n\n \n \n \nforms, eliminating air and stone pockets that may cause honeycombing, pitting, \nor planes of weakness. \n9. \nBring slab surfaces to correct level with straightedge and strikeoff.  Use highway \nstraightedges, bull floats, or darbies to smooth surface free of humps or hollows \nbefore excess moisture or bleedwater appears on the surface.  Do not disturb \nslab surfaces prior to beginning finishing operations. \n10. \nMaintain reinforcing in proper position during concrete placement operations. \n11. \nProtect adjacent finish materials against damage and spatter during concrete \nplacement. \n12. \nPlacing Concrete by Pump:  If concrete is placed by using a pump, the grout \nused for pump priming must not become a part of the completed structure unless \nan engineered grout design mix and grout location are approved in advance by \nthe Engineer. \n3.6 \nFINISH OF FORMED SURFACES \nA. \nGeneral:  Formed surfaces shall have the finishes as described below and as shown on \nthe drawings after formwork is removed and repairs made. \nB. \nClassifications and Finish Requirements: \n1. \nSurface Finish 2.3 (SF-2.3): \na. \nNo formwork-facing material is specified. \nb. \nPatch voids larger than 3/4 inch wide or 1/2 inch deep. \nc. \nPatch tie holes. \nd. \nRemove projections larger than 1/4 inch. \ne. \nProvide surface tolerance Class B as specified in ACI 117. \nC. \nStandard Finish:  Provide SF-1.0 on all concrete surfaces not exposed to view in the final \ncondition unless otherwise specified. \nD. \nExposed Finishes:  Provide SF-2.0 on all concrete surfaces exposed to view in final \ncondition unless otherwise specified. \nE. \nRelated Unformed Surfaces:  At tops of walls, horizontal offsets and similar unformed \nsurfaces occurring adjacent to formed surfaces, strike-off smooth and finish with a texture \nmatching adjacent formed surfaces.

Begin floating, using a hand float, a bladed \npower float equipped with float shoes, or a powered disk float, when the bleed water \nsheen has disappeared and the concrete surface has stiffened sufficiently to permit the \noperation.  Check and level surface plane to a tolerance as specified below.  Cut down \n\n \n \n \nhigh spots and fill low spots.  Uniformly slope surfaces to drains.  Immediately after \nleveling, refloat surface to a uniform, smooth, granular texture. \nC. \nTrowel Finish:  Apply trowel finish to monolithic slab surfaces to be exposed-to-view, and \nslab surfaces to be covered with resilient flooring, carpet, ceramic or quarry tile, paint or \nother thin film finish coating system.

Dissipating \nresin type cures are acceptable in these locations. \n3.10 \nHOT WEATHER CONCRETING \nA. \nDefinition: \n1. \nConditions warranting hot weather concreting practices are defined as any \ncombination of high air temperature, low relative humidity, and wind velocity \ntending to impair the quality of fresh or hardened concrete or otherwise result in \nabnormal properties.  If conditions cause an evaporation rate of 0.2 pounds per \nsquare foot per hour or greater as calculated by the figure \u201cNRMCA Nomograph \nfor Estimating Evaporation Rate on the Basis of Menzel Formula\u201d in Appendix A \nof ACI 305.1, then precautions shall be taken to prevent plastic shrinkage cracks \nfrom occurring. \nB. \nSpecification:  Follow hot weather concreting practices specified below when required to \nlimit the concrete temperature at the truck discharge point to the stated maximum \nacceptable temperature. \nC. \nRecords:  Under hot weather conditions, the Contractor shall keep records of outside air \ntemperature, concrete temperature at truck discharge and general weather conditions. \nD. \nHot Weather Concreting Requirements:  The following items, all or in part as required, \nshall be followed to limit the concrete temperature to the stated maximum acceptable \ntemperature and to minimize the possibility of plastic shrinkage cracks from developing. \n1. \nDesign the concrete mixtures specifically for hot weather conditions replacing \nsome cement with fly ash or other pozzolan and using a water reducing retarding \nadmixture (ASTM C 494 Type D). \n2. \nUse the largest size and amount of coarse aggregate compatible with the job. \n3. \nUse sunshades and/or windbreaks. \n4. \nDelay construction of indoor slabs-on-grade until the walls and roof are \nconstructed. \n5. \nCool and shade aggregate stockpiles. \n6. \nUse ice as part of the mixing water or cool the water with liquid nitrogen.  Do not \nplace concrete that contains unmelted ice. \n7. \nLimit the number of revolutions at mixing speed to 125 maximum. \n8. \nReduce time between mixing and placing as much as possible. \n9. \nDo not add water to ready-mixed concrete at the job site unless it is part of the \namount required initially for the specified water-cement ratio and the specified \nslump. \n10. \nSchedule concrete placement for early morning, late afternoon, or night. \n11. \nHave all forms, equipment, and workers ready to receive and handle concrete. \n12. \nMaintain one standby vibrator for every three vibrators used. \n13. \nKeep all equipment and material cool by spraying with water including exteriors \nof forms, reinforcing steel, subgrade, chutes, conveyors, pump lines, tremies, \nand buggies. \n14. \nProtect slab concrete at all stages against undue evaporation by applying a fog \nspray or mist above the surface or applying a monomolecular film.  Where high \ntemperatures and/or placing conditions dictate, use water-reducing retarding \nadmixture (Type D) in lieu of the water-reducing admixture (Type A) as directed \nby the Owner's Testing Laboratory. \n\n \n \n \n15. \nProvide continuous curing, preferably with water, during the first 24 hours using \nwet burlap, cotton mats, continuous spray mist, or by applying a curing \ncompound meeting ASTM C 1315.  Continue curing for three days minimum. \n16. \nCover reinforcing steel with water soaked burlap so that steel temperature will \nnot exceed ambient air temperature immediately before placement of concrete. \n17. \nAs soon as possible, loosen forms and run water down the inside.  When forms \nare removed, provide a wet cover to newly exposed surfaces. \n3.11 \nCOLD WEATHER CONCRETING \nA. \nDefinition: \n1. \nConcrete shall not be placed when the outside air temperature is 40\u00b0F or less \nunless cold weather concreting practices are followed as specified below. \n2. \nCold weather concreting practices should also be followed whenever the average \ndaily air temperature is expected to be less than 40\u00b0F for more than three \nsuccessive days.  The average daily air temperature is the average of the highest \nand lowest temperature occurring during the period from midnight to midnight.  \nThe requirement for adhering to these cold-weather concreting practices may be \nterminated when the air temperature is above 50\u00ba F for more than half of any 24 \nhour duration. \n3. \nCold-weather concreting practices invoked shall keep the temperature of the \nconcrete immediately after placing within the following temperature ranges: \na. \n55\u00ba to 75\u00ba F for sections less than 12 inches in the least dimension. \nb. \n50\u00ba to 70\u00ba F for sections 12 to 36 inches in the least dimension. \nc. \n45\u00ba to 65\u00ba F for sections 36 to 72 inches in the least dimension. \nd. \n40\u00ba to 60\u00ba F for sections greater than 72 inches in the least dimension. \n4. \nConcrete Protection:  Protect the concrete immediately after placing and during \nthe defined protection period such that the concrete does not freeze nor fall \nbelow the temperature levels stated in the above paragraph.  For concrete not \nloaded during construction, the protection period shall be for a minimum of three \ndays if cold-weather conditions persist.  The time may be reduced to a minimum \nof two days if Type III cement or an accelerating admixture is used or if an \nadditional 100 pounds of cement per cubic yard is added to the concrete mix.  \nConcrete fully loaded during construction shall be protected during cold weather \nconditions for whatever time is required to obtain the required strength as \ndetermined by nondestructive strength tests (Windsor probe, Swiss Hammer \nTest) on the in-place concrete.  Protect concrete surfaces from freezing for the \nfirst 24 hours even if cold-weather conditions do not officially exist due to high \nvolatility in ambient temperatures. \n5. \nProtection Deficiency:  If the temperature requirements during any portion of the \nprotection period are not met but the concrete surface did not freeze, the \nprotection period shall be extended until twice the deficiency expressed in \ndegree-hours is made up.  Deficiency degree-hours are defined as the average \ndeficiency in temperature below the required value times the number of hours the \ndeficiency persisted.  Make-up degree hours are the average increase in \ntemperature above the minimum value times the hours required to make up twice \nthe deficiency degree-hours.  Contact the Architect/Engineer if the concrete \nsurface was allowed to freeze during the protection period. \n6. \nProtection Removal:  As the protection is being removed the decrease in \ntemperature measured at the surface of the concrete in a 24 hour period shall not \nexceed the following: \na. \n50\u00ba F for sections less than 12 inches in the least dimension. \n\n \n \n \nc. \n30\u00ba F for sections 36 to 72 inches in the least dimension. \nd. \n20\u00ba F for sections greater than 72 inches in the least dimension. \n7. \nThe maximum concrete temperature heated by artificial means at point of \nplacement shall not exceed 90\u00b0F. \nB. \nRecords:  Under cold weather conditions, the Contractor shall keep records of outside air \ntemperature, concrete temperature as placed and general weather conditions.  The \ntemperature record shall be taken no less than two times per 24 hour duration. \nC. \nCold Weather Concreting Requirements:  The following items, all or in part as required, \nshould be followed to assure acceptable concrete in cold weather conditions: \n1. \nDesign the concrete mixture to obtain high early strength by using higher cement \ncontent, a high early strength cement (Type III), or a specified non-chloride \naccelerator (ASTM C 494 Type C or E). \n2. \nProtect the concrete during curing period using insulating blankets, insulated \nforms, enclosures, and/or heaters. \n3. \nConcrete cured in heated enclosures shall have heaters vented to prevent \nexposure of concrete and workmen to noxious gases. \n4. \nFrozen subgrade shall be thawed prior to concrete placement and snow and ice \nshall be removed from forms. \n5. \nTemperature of embedments in concrete must be heated to above 32\u00b0F prior to \nplacing concrete \n6. \nHeat the mixing water and then blend hot and cold water to obtain concrete no \nmore than 10\u00b0F above the required temperature. \n7. \nHeat the aggregates by circulating steam in pipes placed in the storage bins for \nair temperatures consistently below 32\u00b0F.  When either water or aggregate is \nheated to over 140\u00b0F, combine them in the mixer first to obtain a maximum \ntemperature of the mixture not to exceed 140\u00b0F in order to prevent flash set of \nthe concrete. \n8. \nUniformly thaw aggregates far in advance of batching to prevent moisture \nvariations in the stockpile. \n9. \nCover warmed stockpiles with tarps to retain heat. \n10. \nPlace air entraining admixture in the batch after the water temperature has been \nreduced by mixing with cooler solid materials. \n11. \nUse wind screens to protect concrete from rapid cooling. \n12. \nPlace vertical pump lines inside the building, if possible, for concrete being \npumped. \n13. \nMaintain artificial heat as low as possible to reduce temperature stresses during \ncooling. \n14. \nAvoid water curing of concrete except for parking garage structures.  Apply the \nrequired curing compound to unformed surfaces as soon as possible to prevent \ndrying of concrete from heated enclosures. \n15. \nDelay form stripping as long as possible to help prevent drying from heated \nenclosures and to reduce damage to formed surfaces caused by premature \nstripping. \n16. \nProvide triple thickness of insulating materials at corners and edges vulnerable to \nfreezing. \n17. \nWrap protruding reinforcing bars with insulation to avoid heat drain from the \nwarm concrete. \n18. \nGradually reduce the heat at the end of the heating period to reduce likelihood of \nthermal shock. \n\n \n \n \n3.12 \nMISCELLANEOUS CONCRETE ITEMS \nA. \nFilling-In:  Fill-in holes and openings left in concrete structures for passage of work by \nother trades, unless otherwise shown or directed, after work of other trades is in place.  \nMix, place, and cure concrete as herein specified, to blend with in-place construction.  \nProvide other miscellaneous concrete filling shown or required to complete work. \nB. \nCurbs:  Provide monolithic finish to interior curbs by stripping forms while concrete is still \ngreen and steel-troweling surfaces to a hard, dense finish with corners, intersections, and \nterminations slightly rounded. \nC. \nEquipment Bases and Foundations:  Provide machine and equipment bases and \nfoundations, as shown on drawings.  Set anchor rods for machines and equipment to \ntemplate at correct elevations, complying with certified diagrams or templates of \nmanufacturer furnishing machines and equipment. \nD. \nSteel Pan Stairs:  Provide concrete fill for steel pan stair treads and landings and \nassociated items.  Cast-in safety inserts and accessories as shown on drawings.  Screed, \ntamp and finish concrete surfaces as scheduled. \nE. \nAdhesive Anchors: All drilled holes for adhesive anchors shall be within six degrees of \nperpendicular to the surface of the concrete member. \n3.13 \nINVESTIGATION OF LOW CONCRETE STRENGTH TEST RESULTS \nA. \nContractor Responsibility for Low Strength Concrete: \n1. \nIf the average of any three consecutive strength tests falls below the required f\u2019c \nfor a class of concrete but no individual strength test is more than 500 PSI below \nthe required f\u2019c, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Engineer by \ntelephone or email and take immediate steps to increase the average of \nsubsequent strength tests. \n2. \nIf any individual strength test falls more than 500 PSI below the required f'c, the \nContractor shall immediately notify the Engineer by telephone or e-mail and take \nimmediate steps to assure that the load-carrying capacity of the structure is not \njeopardized. \nB. \nAdditional Field Tests to Confirm Low Concrete Strengths: \n1. \nThe cost of all investigations of low-strength concrete, as defined by any \nindividual strength test being more than 500 PSI below the required f\u2019c, shall be \nborne by the Contractor. \n2. \nCode-Prescribed Acceptance:  The only accepted field-test methods of \ndetermining actual in-situ concrete strength is by the way of core tests as \nprescribed by ACI 318. \n3. \nNon-Destructive Tests:  If any individual strength test falls more than 500 PSI \nbelow the required f'c, the Engineer may request that non-destructive field tests \nbe performed on the concrete in question using Swiss Hammer, Windsor Probe, \nor other appropriate methods as approved by the Engineer.  Report the \ncomparative test results of the suspect concrete under consideration with \nidentical tests done on concrete of known strength and of the same class.  The \nEngineer considers these test results as only approximate indicators of strength \nand may not necessarily, by themselves, resolve the low concrete strength issue.  \nThese test results will be considered as additional information by which to make \n\n \n \n \nbased on the results of these approximate tests or order that core tests be taken \nas prescribed below.  At the Contractor\u2019s option, the approximate non-destructive \nfield-tests may be waived and core tests immediately initiated. \n4. \nCore Tests:  If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the likelihood of low-strength \nconcrete is confirmed and it has been determined that the load-carrying capacity \nof the structure is significantly reduced as a result, the Engineer may request that \ncore tests be taken from the area in question as directed by the Engineer.  There \nshall be a minimum of three cores taken for each strength test more than 500 \nPSI below the required f'c in accordance with ASTM C 42.  If concrete in the \nstructure will be dry under service conditions, cores shall be air dried \n(temperature 60\u00b0 to 80\u00b0F, relative humidity less than 60 percent) for seven days \nbefore test and shall be tested dry.  If concrete in the structure will be more than \nsuperficially wet under service conditions, cores shall be immersed in water for at \nleast 40 hours and tested wet.  The Contractor shall fill all holes made by drilling \ncores with an approved drypack concrete. \n5. \nAcceptance Criteria for Core Test:  Concrete in an area represented by core \ntests shall be considered adequate if the average of three cores is equal to at \nleast 85% of the required f'c and no single core is less than 75% of the required \nf'c.  If approved by the Engineer, locations of erratic core strengths may be \nretested to check testing accuracy. \n6. \nLoad Test:  If the concrete strength is not considered adequate based on core \ntests and the structural adequacy remains in doubt, the Engineer may order a \nload test as specified in ACI 318 be conducted for the questionable portion of the \nstructure. \n7. \nStrengthening or Demolition of the Structure:  If the structural adequacy of the \naffected portion of the structure remains in doubt following the load test, the \nEngineer may order the structure to be strengthened by an appropriate means or \ndemolished and rebuilt at the Contractor's expense. \n3.14 \nCONCRETE SURFACE REPAIRS \nA. \nDefective Areas: \n1. \nFormed Surfaces:  Concrete surfaces requiring repairs shall include all cracks in \nexcess of 1/16 in width and any other defects that affect the durability or \nstructural integrity of the concrete.  Voids, including honeycombing and rock \npockets, and tie holes shall be repaired as required by the specified Surface \nFinish. \n2. \nUnformed Surfaces:  Concrete surfaces requiring repair shall include all surface \ndefects such as crazing, cracks in excess of 1/16\u201d   in width or cracks that \npenetrate to reinforcement or through the member, popouts, spalling, and \nhoneycombs. \nB. \nClassification: \n1. \nStructural Concrete Repair:  Major defective areas in concrete members that are \nload carrying (such as shear walls, beams, joists and slabs), are highly stressed, \nand are vital to the structural integrity of the structure shall require structural \nrepairs.  Structural concrete repairs shall be made using a two-part epoxy \nbonder, epoxy mortar, or specified polymer repair mortar.  The Engineer shall \ndetermine the locations of required structural concrete repairs. \n2. \nCosmetic Concrete Repair:  Defective areas in concrete members that are non-\nload carrying and minor defective areas in load carrying concrete members shall \nrequire cosmetic concrete repair when exposed to view and not covered up by \n\n \n \n \nrepair mortar and compatible bonding agent.  The Architect/Engineer shall \ndetermine the locations of required cosmetic concrete repairs.  Stains and other \ndiscolorations that cannot be removed by cleaning and are exposed to view will \nrequire cosmetic repair.  Cosmetic concrete repair in exposed-to-view surfaces \nwill require Architect's approval prior to patching operation. \n3. \nSlab Repairs:  High and low areas in concrete slabs shall be repaired by \nremoving and replacing defective slab areas unless an alternate method, such as \ngrinding and/or filling with self-leveling underlayment compound or repair mortar \nis approved by the Architect/Engineer.

When pro-\ngrammed or wired backwards, the valve will open when being commanded to close, causing the space to \noverheat.  To verify proper wiring and programming, during a period of general cooling, verify that the ac-\ntual space temperature is within 2F of the (setpoint plus any user adjustment), unless in a fluctuating area \n(entry, etc.).  Space temperatures more than 2F above the net setpoint indicate possible control valve \nproblems.

Install \nblinds in flanged joints to isolate equipment. \n5. \nInstall safety valve, set at a pressure no more than one-third higher than test \npressure, to protect against damage by expanding liquid or other source of \noverpressure during test. \nB. \nPerform the following tests on hydronic piping: \n1. \nUse ambient temperature water as a testing medium unless there is risk of damage \ndue to freezing.  Another liquid that is safe for workers and compatible with piping \nmay be used. \n2. \nWhile filling system, use vents installed at high points of system to release air.  Use \ndrains installed at low points for complete draining of test liquid. \n3. \nIsolate expansion tanks and determine that hydronic system is full of water. \n4. \nSubject piping system to hydrostatic test pressure that is not less than 1.5 times the \nsystem's working pressure.  Test pressure shall not exceed maximum pressure for \nany vessel, pump, valve, or other component in system under test.  Verify that \nstress due to pressure at bottom of vertical runs does not exceed 90 percent of \nspecified minimum yield strength or 1.7 times \"SE\" value in Appendix A in \nASME B31.9, \"Building Services Piping.\" \n\n \n5. \nAfter hydrostatic test pressure has been applied for at least 10 minutes, examine \npiping, joints, and connections for leakage.  Eliminate leaks by tightening, repairing, \nor replacing components, and repeat hydrostatic test until there are no leaks. \n6. \nPrepare written report of testing. \nC. \nPerform the following before operating the system: \n1. \nOpen manual valves fully. \n2. \nInspect pumps for proper rotation. \n3. \nSet makeup pressure-reducing valves for required system pressure. \n4. \nInspect air vents at high points of system and determine if all are installed and \noperating freely (automatic type), or bleed air completely (manual type). \n5. \nSet temperature controls so all coils are calling for full flow. \n6. \nInspect and set operating temperatures of hydronic equipment, such as boilers, \nchillers, cooling towers, to specified values. \n7. \nVerify lubrication of motors and bearings. \nEND OF SECTION 232113 \nNEW SECTION STARTS HERE", "SECTION 232116": "\n\nSECTION 232116 - HYDRONIC PIPING SPECIALTIES \nPART 1 - GENERAL \nPART 1 - GENERAL \n1.01 \nRELATED DOCUMENTS \nA. \nDrawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary \nConditions and Division 01 Specification Sections, apply to this Section. \n1.02 \nSUMMARY \nA. \nSection includes special-duty valves and specialties for the following: \n1. \nHot-water heating piping. \n2. \nChilled-water piping. \n3. \nDual-temperature heating and cooling water piping. \n4. \nCondenser-water piping. \n5. \nGlycol cooling-water piping. \n6. \nMakeup-water piping. \n7. \nCondensate-drain piping. \n8. \nBlowdown-drain piping. \n9. \nAir-vent piping. \n10. \nSafety-valve-inlet and -outlet piping. \n1.03 \nACTION SUBMITTALS \nA. \nProduct Data: For each type of the following: \n1. \nValves: Include flow and pressure drop curves based on manufacturer's testing for \ncalibrated-orifice balancing valves and automatic flow-control valves. \n2. \nAir-control devices. \n3. \nHydronic specialties. \n1.04 \nCLOSEOUT SUBMITTALS \nA. \nOperation and Maintenance Data: For air-control devices, hydronic specialties, and special-duty \nvalves to include in emergency, operation, and maintenance manuals. \n1.05 \nMAINTENANCE MATERIAL SUBMITTALS \nA. \nDifferential Pressure Meter: For each type of balancing valve and automatic flow control valve, \ninclude flowmeter, probes, hoses, flow charts, and carrying case. \n1.06 \nQUALITY ASSURANCE \nA. \nPipe Welding: Qualify procedures and operators according to ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCode: Section IX. \n1. \nSafety valves and pressure vessels shall bear the appropriate ASME label.

Work must \nbe undertaken in accordance with the most current practices supported by the experience and \ntechnical knowledge of Environmental Hygiene Services.  \n \nThe procedure defined herein assumes the systems are in good mechanical condition.  Should the \nsystem contain or is discovered to contain excessive scale, corrosion, grease, sludge or any other \nabnormal conditions, a full site survey must be conducted to determine the extent of the problem.  \nOtherwise excessive contamination will limit the effectiveness of this procedure.  Any alternative \nprocedures must be discussed before further action is taken, and the process must include the \nsupervision of a trained expert (Specialist Lead). Alternative procedures must be documented and \nmust be included in the Nalco scope of work. \n \nB. Health and Safety \n1) A pre-job meeting is the first step before any work begins. Utilize the Nalco Be Safe card to \nhelp identify the hazards and complete a Job Safety Analysis (JSA).  A generic JSA for \ndisinfection of cooling towers is located in the Nalco Code of Safety P4 Manual. \n2) In compliance with local Health and Safety requirements, all personnel involved with the \nprocedure must wear full or half-face respirators fitted with a combination cartridge/filter \n(99.97% particulate and organic vapor/acid gases) during disinfection activities. \n3) Unauthorized customer site personnel or others who do not have the proper training or the \nrequired Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) cannot enter the vicinity of the working area \nunless suitable precautions (including medical clearance, training, and PPE) to safeguard \npersonnel have been taken. All work activities must be stopped if unauthorized personnel \nenter the work area. The pre-job meeting with the customer must include a review about this \ncontrol measure. \n4) Additional safety measures determined by the risk assessment may include but is not \nlimited to the following life critical procedures for confined space entry, LOTO, working at \nheights, electrical safety, review of chemical SDS, performing effective pre-job planning \nand communication. \n \nC. Required Training Prior to Start of Work \n1) Certified to perform risk assessments \n2) Trained in hazard communication and chemical handling \n3) Trained and medically cleared and fit tested to wear and use a respirator \n4) Certified to work in confined spaces \n5) Trained to perform Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) \n6) Trained to work at heights and in fall protection \n7) Trained in the proper use of PPE \n \n\n \n \nD. Required PPE \nThe required PPE is summarized below but is not limited to this list. Equivalent PPE may also be used in \nplace of PPE brands described. \n \n1) Hard hat and face shield including chin guard for \nhandling chemical. \n2) Chemical splash goggles. Eye and face protection \nis not required when using a full face respirator. \n3) Hearing protection. \n4) Respirator fitted with combination cartridge/filter \n(99.97% particulate and organic vapor/acid gases). \n5) SHOWA Best\u00ae Glove Size 10 Blue Atlas\u00ae 12\" \nAramid Lined Kevlar\u00ae and PVC Fully Coated \nChemical Resistant Gloves with Rough Finish for \npressure washing. \n6) Cut Armor 5 large general-purpose gloves for \nequipment handling. \n7) Calf-high waterproof footwear with steel toe. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nE. Customer Responsibilities \nThe customer is responsible to comply with all requirements listed prior to the arrival of Nalco service \ncrew members.  The customer is responsible to\u2026 \n1) provide a responsible engineer fully conversant with the system and its operation to \nadvise the Nalco Services Lead Specialist on all relevant system and site details; \n2) open system blowdown at the maximum sustainable rate 24 hours prior to arrival of Nalco \nservice crew members.  This is necessary to reduce system pH below 8.0 to minimize \noxidizing biocide demand; \n3) provide a means for disposal of effluent to enable all systems to be drained simultaneously \nwith all drain valves fully opened without causing flooding. Means of disposal must be \ncapable of receiving at least double the system volume, and the customer must be satisfied \nthat these points can accept the quantity of effluent being discharged; \n4) provide a 20A 120V 60Hz single-phase electrical supply near the working area; \n5) notify the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) that neutralized chlorine solutions will be \ndischarged; \n6) provide parking and off-loading facilities in close vicinity of the cooling tower systems. \nCertain heavy equipment may be used and lift facilities may be necessary to gain access to \nupper or lower floors as required; \n\n \n7) provide free, safe and unrestricted access to the cooling tower systems and associated pipe \nwork for the duration that Nalco service crews are on site; \n \n8) turn off all water treatment dosage and control equipment just prior to the arrival of Nalco \nService crew members; and \n \nF. Disinfection Procedure \nSystem water must flow though all side stream devices, secondary loops, balancing lines and cross-\nconnections during the disinfection process. Examples of secondary loops or side stream devices include \nplate and frame heat exchanger for \u201cfree cooling\u201d during the winter, sand filters, etc. Any sections or devices \nnot circulated are a potential contamination source when opened. No part of the system should be out-of-\nservice during the disinfection process and all condenser water pumps should be operational during \ndisinfection. \n \n1) Personal Service Report (Value Add Requirement): Inspect system for excessive \ncontamination and damage before starting disinfection. Review with customer and \ndocument in the Personal Service Report (TS 320.3 NA). \n2) Confirm customer has turned off, isolated and LOTO all water treatment dosage and \ncontrol equipment that may be affected or damaged by the high oxidant concentration. \n3) Confirm there is no flow through the Nalco 3D TRASAR system, if installed, by checking \nthe flow meter float which should drop to the minimum level and notify the Nalco System \nAssurance Center that the system is temporarily off-line. \n4) Confirm customer has turned off and LOTO cooling tower fans or at minimum reduced \ncooling tower fan speeds to reduce drift loss from the system. \n5) Confirm customer has switched off and LOTO system blow-down, and the makeup water valve \nis open. \n6) Confirm customer has closed and LOTO building fresh air intake vents within 100 feet \nof the cooling tower (especially those downwind) until disinfection is completed. \n7) Confirm with customer that all condensing water pumps are on and ensure that water is \nflowing through the entire system for the disinfection process. \n8) Confirm with customer that all side stream devices, secondary loops, balancing lines and \ncross- connections are open to allow flow during the disinfection process. No part of the \nsystem should be out- of-service during the disinfection process. \n9) Begin the disinfection procedure by adding an oxidizing biocide (chlorine- or bromine-\nbased) to the cooling tower sump or basin per one of the following: \n\u00bb \nIf system pH is less than 8.0, add oxidizing biocide to achieve at least 10 mg/L \nand maintain 5 mg/L as free chlorine for 6-hours. \n\u00bb \nIf system pH is greater than 8.0, add oxidizing biocide to achieve at least 25 mg/L \nand maintain 15 mg/L as free chlorine for 6-hours. \n\u00bb \nIf a 6-hour disinfection cannot be performed, add oxidizing biocide to achieve at \nleast 50 mg/L and maintain 25 mg/L as free chlorine for 1-hour. \n\n \n \n \n10) Simultaneously or within 15 minutes of adding oxidizing biocide add a dispersant and \nantifoam per label use directions to the tower sump to yield: \n\u00bb \n5 to 10 ppm Nalco 73551 or 73550 dispersant (recommended) \n\u00bb \nAdd Nalco 71D5-Plus antifoam as needed (recommended) \n \n \n11) Allow the system to mix for 15 minutes and measure free chlorine using high range free \nchlorine indicator strips or equivalent to verify system dose. Confirm the level of oxidizing \nbiocide during the disinfection period initially and then every 15 minutes if performing a 1-\nhour disinfection or every 30-minutes if performing a 6-hour disinfection. Add additional \noxidizing biocide to maintain the minimum target dose during the disinfection period. \n12) Record results in the Procedure Log (TS 320.2 NA). Record action taken, amounts of \noxidizing biocide added for future reference, and free chlorine levels achieved and \nmaintained. \n13) Instruct the customer to drain the tower upon completion. High concentrations of chlorine may \nnot be allowed to enter the sewer system or controlled waters and should be neutralized \nbefore discharged. The customer must confirm requirements with the local AHJ. \n14) Inform customer to refill the system with fresh water. \n15) Inform customer to remove all LOTO devices \n16) Inform customer to open any building fresh air intakes that were closed. \n17) Inform customer to turn on scale and corrosion feed equipment and resume the water \ntreatment program (including biocide treatment). Arrangements must be made by the \ncustomer to ensure the water treatment program resumes normal operation if the water \ntreatment program is not under the control of Nalco. \n18) Inform customer to turn on system blowdown for 24 hours to allow system release of \nbiofilms and other solids that may remain suspended in the system. \n19) Inform customer to return any side stream devices, secondary loops, balancing \nlines and cross- connections back into service or place back out of service, as \nneeded. \n20) Inform customer that all equipment must be returned to normal operation after the 24-hour \nblowdown period. Arrangements must be made by the customer to ensure the water \ntreatment program resumes normal operation if the water treatment program is not under \nthe control of Nalco. \n \n \nNote: If the system pH is greater than 8.0, it may be necessary to open the blow-down valve to reduce the system pH below \n8.0 before adding oxidizing biocide. In addition, high doses of oxidizing biocides applied as a disinfection measure may attack \nthe materials of construction and cause corrosion. Appropriate precautions such as applying a corrosion inhibitor should be \ntaken when possible. \nNote: Nalco dispersant aids to penetrate biofilms, disperse solids and enhance the disinfection process. Solids and biofilms \nare removed upon system draining and during the 24-hour blowdown period. \n\n \nG.

Individual Engine Start signals are \nhardwired from each ATS so that generators may be started in event of a partial outage \nsensed at an individual ATS. \n \n3. \nSystem Rating is 13,200V, 3P, 3W.  This system is set up for 3 generators.  Generators are \nrated 13,200V, 3P, 4W and 3000kW. All generators must be matched in pitch. \n \n4. \nLoad is distributed via normally closed feeder breakers that are connected to unit \nsubstations and then to low voltage ATS\u2019s to the emergency bus.  Load will be added via \nATS\u2019s and Chiller Load Control Program based on available capacity, priority and time \ndelay settings. Load Shed is accomplished via the ATS\u2019s and the Chiller Load Control \nProgram. \n \n5. \nIn addition, there are two transfer pairs located in the MSBMA-CEP-001-NPM001/ MSBMB-\nCEP-001-NPM002 lineup that will allow for picking up the entire load.  For the MSBMA-\nCEP-001-NPM001/ MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002 board, load shed will be done using a \n\n \nD. \nControls: \n1. \nSystem control is integrated within the switchgear lineup and distributed in several locations \nand across multiple controllers. \n \n2. \nMaster PLC: Master PLC is Square D Modicon PLC M580 which will be located in the \nMaster section along with the PowerQuest screen. The Master PLC includes two separate \nEthernet Interfaces. One is used for IO communication and the other is used to interface \nwith the OIT. \n \n3. \nRedundant Master PLC: Redundant Master PLC shall be identical to the Master PLC and \noperate in a hot standby synchronized manner with the master. \n \n4. \nSystem IO: System IO is distributed across several different locations.  Distributed IO is \nlocated in the Master section as well as in the switchgear. Redundant IO shall be provided \nfor each IO point. \n \n5. \nGenerator PLC\u2019s: Generator PLC\u2019s are Square D Modicon M340.  One will be provided for \neach generator in each generator section.  Generator control is integrated with the \nswitchgear.  Generator IO is integral to the generator PLC and is controlled by that PLC \nonly.  The generator PLC includes an Ethernet interface to communicate to the PowerQuest \nscreen in the master section for operator interface.   A hardwired backup circuit is provided \nto get and keep the generator online when required even if the generator PLC has failed. \n \n6. \nGenerator Synchronizer and Load Controllers: These controllers will be Woodward Digital \nSynchronizer and Load Share Controllers (model DSLC2) with redundant Ethernet \ncommunication LANs for load control and monitoring. \n \n7. \nMaster Synchronizer: There is one Master Synchronizer (model MSLC2) in this system \nacross the bus tie breaker (52T).  There are redundant Ethernet LAN\u2019s for communicating \nbetween the MSLC and the DSLCs. \n \n8. \nPowerQuest Screen (OIT): There will be one Operator Interface Terminal (OIT) in the \nMaster Section. The OIT provides SCADA/HMI functionality and serves as the operator \ninterface with the System controller for adjustable settings.  These settings will be password \nprotected. A system one-line will be provided showing all devices controlled by the ASCO \nPLCs. \n \n9. \nTransfer Switches: ASCO PLC interface for Transfer Switches will be located in the Master \nsection. The Engine Start signals and Load Shed (which functions as Load Add Permissive) \nsignals will be hardwired to the distributed I/O in the Master Section. \nE. \nModes: \n1. \nNormal Mode \na. \nWhenever the individual engine generator control switches are placed in their \nautomatic position, the engine generator system is on standby in readiness for \nautomatic starting and synchronization in the event of a power failure signal. \n \nb. \nNormal/Automatic position of all control switches listed below  \n \nMaster Control Station: \n\u2013\n\n \nGenerator Control Station: \nEngine Control Switch: Auto \nSync Mode Switch: Run \nEmergency Stop: Out (Not Active) \n \nc. \nPosition of Breakers as follows: \nMSBMA-CEP-001-NPM001/ MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002 \nAll breakers closed except Generator Main #1 and Generator Main #2 and Tie \nBreaker. \n \nThe closing of the tie breaker shall be via manual means only. The control logic and \ninterlocking shall only allow the tie breaker to be closed if only one of the four source \nbreakers (Utility Feed A, Utility Feed B, Generator Feed A, Generator Feed B) is \nclosed. If more than one source breaker is closed, closure of the tie breaker shall be \nprevented. \n \nPGA-CEP-002-EMP001/PGA-CEP-002-EPM002 \nAll breakers closed except Generator #1, #2, and #3, and tie breaker. \n \n2. \nEmergency Mode: \na. \nAny time a Utility outage is sensed and/or Generators are called to start in \nanticipation of feeding building load, the system will annunciate this condition as \nEmergency mode.   ATS\u2019s issue auto start signals upon sensing Utility failure via the \nstart signals on the low voltage transfer switches.  All generators will be started. \n \nb. \nAll generator(s) automatically start and come up to speed. \n \n(1) \nThe first generator set achieve nominal voltage and a frequency shall be \nconnected to the bus. \n(2) \nAfter a bus is energized by one generator, the synchronizers for the remaining \ngenerators associated with that bus will automatically adjust the frequency of \nthe next on-coming generator to synchronize with the bus.  When synchronism \nis achieved, the on-coming generator is paralleled to the bus and generators \nwill share load. \n(3) \nAfter all generators are connected to their respective busses within the \nsynchronizing switchgear, the two sides of the bus within the switchgear will \nautomatically adjust their frequency to synchronize the two busses and allow \nthe tie breaker to close. When full synchronism is achieved, all generators will \nshare the load. \n \n2.03 \nSYNCHRONIZING CONTROLS \nA. \nGeneral:  The following specifications cover the requirements for providing a source of standby \npower including; \n  \n1. \nEngine Generator Control Switchgear \n \nB. \nEngine Generator Control Switchgear: Provide a complete free-standing assembly containing \ncircuit breakers and control devices for operation, control, and synchronization of the engine \ngenerator sets as shown on drawings. \n \n1. \nProvide the fully automatic generator control switchgear arranged to control the operation of \n\n \naccordance with the applicable standards of UL, NEMA, ANSI, and IEEE for metal-enclosed \nmedium voltage switchgear and shall consist of engine generator control cubicles, master \ncubicle, and distribution cubicles, all as shown on drawings.  The generator circuit breaker \nload terminals shall be connected to a horizontal bus structure and the output of the \ngenerating system shall be connected to the distribution cubicles. \n \n2. \nThe system bus, control relays, and control circuits shall be designed and sized to \naccommodate a future engine generator to operate as specified herein. The master control \ncubicle shall be provided complete with all mounting blocks, hardware, wiring harnesses, \nand associated equipment, to accept the future engine generators and peak shaving \ncontrols with the least amount of installation, field work and shutdown periods when \ninstalled in the future. \n \nC. \nControls:  Provide interconnecting control circuits to produce the following normal operating \nfunctions: \n1. \nOperation of the engine contact on the automatic transfer switches set up the circuit to the \nengine starting circuits provided with the generator control switchgear. \n \n2. \nThe engine generators shall be brought up to speed and closed into the emergency \nswitchgear main bus through their individual generator breakers.  Voltage and frequency \nrelays shall be provided for each generator to lock the generator from the main bus until \ncorrect voltage and frequency are reached. \n \n3. \nAny engine generator on each side of the Tie Breaker shall be capable of being first to \nassume bus load, depending upon which first reaches correct voltage and frequency.  The \nother incoming generators shall automatically synchronize and parallel with the first unit.  \nThe generator(s) shall then be synchronized across the tie breaker.  All control for auxiliary \nrelays, circuit breakers, synchronizing and other automatic equipment shall be obtained \nfrom the station batteries and the engine starting battery. \na. \nThe tie breaker shall be capable of being manually opened by the system operator \ncreating two separate and independent busses within the synchronizing switchgear. \nEach bus shall be monitored and controlled separately to ensure system stability no \ndifferently than if they were combined. \n \n4. \nAny engine generator shall start and assume load within ten seconds after start circuit is \nenergized, and balance of generators shall be synchronized, paralleled, and divide the load \nupon reaching rated speed, voltage and frequency. \n \n5. \nUpon restoration of the commercial power, transfer of load to commercial power by the \nautomatic transfer switches shall occur and generator breakers shall open.  Engines shall \ncontinue to run at no load for an adjustable period of time from 0 to 30 minutes before \ncomplete shutdown occurs.  The shutdown time delay relay shall be supplied with the \ngenerator control switchboard. \n \nD. \nControl Design:  Provide control circuits, interlocks, and relays to protect against overloading.  \nThe control design shall provide the following function: \n \n1. \nAllow only Priority #1 ATS\u2019s to be connected to the emergency bus until additional \ngenerators are connected in parallel to the emergency switchboard bus. \n \n2. \nReduce the load on the emergency bus in case of failure of any engine generator shedding \n\n \nof failed engine generator, the load shall be automatically re-added to the bus via sub-\npriority schedule programmed into the bus optimization program. \n \nE. \nTransfer to Emergency: \n1. \nPriority #1 Low Voltage Transfer Switches: \na. \nWhen the first generator is connected to bus all Priority 1 loads will transfer through \nthe low voltage transfer switches. \n2. \nPriority #2 Low Voltage Transfer Switches \na. \nAs soon as the second generator is connected to the bus all of the Priority 2 loads \nwill begin their step time delay. \n(1) \nWhen the time delay is complete (or if the time delay is set to zero), the load \nwill immediately receive a permissive signal to release the load shed and \ntransfer to emergency power. \n3. \nPriority #3 Low Voltage Transfer Switches \na. \nAs soon as the third generator is connected to the bus all the Priority 3 loads will \nbegin their step time delay. \n(1) \nWhen the time delay is complete (or if the time delay is set to zero), the load \nwill immediately receive a permissive signal to release the load shed and \ntransfer to emergency power. \n4. \nPriority #3 Medium Voltage Transfer Switch MSBMA-CEP-001-NPM001 \na. \nOnce all generators are established to the emergency bus the system will transfer \nemergency power to the MSBMA-CEP-001-NPM001 using the two generator/utility \nmains located in MSBMA-CEP-001-NPM001. \nb. \nThese pairs act as a Medium Voltage Transfer Switch in a manner consistent with the \nlow voltage units.  However, there is an additional step required. \nc. \nThe following feeder breakers on MSBMA-CEP-001-NPM001 will be opened: \n(1) \nBreaker MSBA-CEP-001-NPH001 \n(2) \nBreaker MV-1MSB1 \n(3) \nBreaker MV-1MSB3 \nd. \nThe chiller breakers remain closed. \ne. \nThe Medium Voltage Transfer Pair will then transfer to emergency on MSBMA-CEP-\n001-NPM001 picking up the chiller plant loads as determined by the Chiller Load \nControl Program. \nf. \nAt that point pending load headroom on the bus, Breaker MSBA-CEP-001-NPH001, \nBreaker MV-1MSB1, and Breaker MV-1MBS3 can be closed in order to provide \nemergency power to those loads not supported by the low voltage transfer switches. \nThis can be programmed as either a manual or automatic function (to be \n\n \ng. \nSince at that point the low voltage transfer switches will now see \u201cNORMAL \nPOWER\u201d, which is actually \u201cEMERGENCY GENERATOR\u201d power, a signal; will be \nsend to all low voltage transfer switches in order to hold them in the \u201cEMERGENCY\u201d \nposition. \n5. \nPriority #3 Medium Voltage Transfer Switch MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002: \na. \nOnce all generators are established to the emergency bus the system will transfer \nemergency power to the MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002 using the two generator/utility \nmains located in MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002. \nb. \nThese pairs act as a Medium Voltage Transfer Switch in a manner consistent with the \nlow voltage units.  However, there is an additional step required. \nc. \nThe following feeder breakers on MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002 will be opened: \n(1) \nBreaker MSBB-CEP-001-NPH002 \n(2) \nBreaker MV-1MSB2 \nd. \nThe chiller breakers remain closed. \ne. \nThe Medium Voltage Transfer Pair will then transfer to emergency on MSBMB-CEP-\n001-NPM002 picking up the chiller plant loads as determined by the Chiller Load \nControl Program. \nf. \nAt that point pending load headroom on the bus, Breaker MSBB-CEP-001-NPM002, \nand Breaker MV-1MBS2 can be closed in order to provide emergency power to those \nloads not supported by the low voltage transfer switches. This can be programmed \nas either a manual or automatic function (to be determined). During Phase 1B of the \nproject, only Breaker MV-1MSB2 shall function in this manner. For Breaker MSBB-\nCEP-001-NPH002 this functionality shall be de-activated until a later phase of the \nproject. \ng. \nSince at that point the low voltage transfer switches will now see \u201cNORMAL \nPOWER\u201d, which is actually \u201cEMERGENCY GENERATOR\u201d power, a signal; will be \nsend to all low voltage transfer switches in order to hold them in the \u201cEMERGENCY\u201d \nposition. \n6. \nNote: If priority 1 loads are not calling for an engine start because they have not lost normal \npower, a priority-pass along feature will be activated to allow priority 2 loads to be added \nwith only one generator online \nF. \nChiller Load Control Program: \n1. \nThe Chiller Load Control Program will be a function of the Building Automation System \n(BAS) which will control and sequence the chillers and associated supporting loads (i.e. \ncooling towers, chilled water pumps, condenser water pumps, etc.) based on the facility \nchilled water needs and the available power to support them. A series of interconnected \nsignals between the Generator Switchgear and the BAS system will be required to \naccommodate this. These interconnected signals will include the following at a minimum: \na. \nNormal/Utility Power available \n\n \nb. \nGenerator/Emergency Power running \n(1) \nUnder Emergency Mode, the chilled water system shall operate as defined \nunder Division 23 and as outlined below: \n(a) \nUpon initiation of the Emergency Mode, a signal shall be sent to the BAS \nindicating that there has been a loss of normal power and that the \ngenerator(s) are running. \n(b) \nPrior to the operation of the Medium Voltage Transfer Switches MSBMA-\nCEP-001-NPM001 or MSBMB-CEP-001-NPM002 in either direction a \npretransfer signal shall be sent to the BAS. This signal shall initiate \nchiller system shutdown prior to the medium voltage transfer switches \noperating. \n(c) \nOnce the chiller system is shutdown, the medium voltage transfer \nswitch(es) shall be allowed to operate. Upon transfer to the alternate \nsource, a signal shall be sent to the BAS indicating that the load bus is \nconnected to the alternate source (there shall be separate indications for \nthe load being connected to the utility/normal source and the \ngenerator/emergency source). \n \n(d) \nUnder Emergency Mode, there shall be separate signals sent from the \nGenerator Switchgear to the BAS system to allow for each sub-block \nload to operate. These sub-blocks shall be defined as follows: \n \n\u2022 \nChilled water plant supporting loads (i.e. cooling towers, chilled \nwater pumps, condenser water pumps) \n\u2022 \nFirst chiller in sequence \n\u2022 \nSecond chiller in sequence \n\u2022 \nContinuing for each chiller that is part of the chilled water system \n\u2022 \nAny additional loads desired beyond the chilled water system \nloads \n\u2022 \nThe system shall support a minimum of 12 defined sub-block \nloads \n(e) \nIf load is required to be shed from the generator system, the sub-block \nloads shall be shut down and removed from operation, in reverse order \nof being added, to ensure the stability of the emergency power system. \nG. \nRe-transfer to Normal: \n1. \nUpon sensing that normal utility power has been restored to acceptable limits, a sequence \nshall begin to transfer the load back to the utility source. \n2. \nThe Priority #3 Medium Voltage ATS will transfer back first. Once the Priority #3 Medium \nVoltage ATSs are transferred back, the signal holding the low voltage transfer switch(es) in \nemergency will be released.  Once this occurs the individual onboard ATS controllers will \ntake over and initiate retransfer to utility on their own. \n3. \nAll times delay for retransfer are contained in the induvial transfer switch controllers. \n4. \nOnce all transfer switches are back to normal, the system will initiate an engine cooldown \nand shutdown and the system will be ready for the next outage. \n \n\n \nH. \nTesting:  Provide selector switches in the emergency generator control switchboard to permit \noperation and testing as follows; \n \n1. \nTwo-Position Master \"Automatic-Manual\" Selector Switch; \n \na. \nIn the \"automatic\" position, all functions shall perform in the sequence as specified \nherein. \nb. \nIn the \"manual\" position, all automatic functions shall be locked out, and the opening \nand closing of breakers and synchronizing and paralleling procedures may be \nmanually performed. \n \n2. \nFive Position Engine Selector Switch: Provide a five-position engine test selector switch in \neach engine generator control panel. \n \na. Stop/Reset: In this position, the engine shall not be capable of starting and/or \nrunning.  If the engine was shutdown due to the operation of a protective device, the \nshutdown malfunction shall be reset when the switch is moved to this position.  If the \nengine is running when the switch is moved to this position, it shall be immediately \nshutdown. \nb. Off/Cooldown: In this position, the engine shall shutdown after a cooldown period. \nc. Automatic: In this position, the engine control shall be in readiness for fully \nautomatic operation upon receipt of a start signal. \nd. Test Off-Line: When placed in this position, the engine shall start and run as if a start \nsignal were received except it shall not be connected to the bus unless a start signal \nis received.  When returned to the automatic position, the engine will shut down after \na cooldown period. \ne.

To shut \ndown an engine generator, disconnect it from the main bus, and illuminate a light to indicate the \nnature of the failure.   \n \nB. \nShutdown:  Depending upon the seriousness of the failure, the engine generator shall be shut \ndown immediately or shall be operated long enough to start the next standby engine generator in \nsequence if the plant is operating in the automatic mode.   \n \nC. \nManual:  If the generating plant is operating manually with the master selector switch in the \nmanual position, a failure can be reset by returning the engine selector switch to \"stop\" and then \nback to \"run\".   \n \nD. \nAuto:  If the generating plant is running automatically with the master selector switch in the \"auto\" \nposition, the fail light shall be accompanied by a lockout light and relay that locks the engine \ngenerator out of the automatic mode of operation.   \n \nE. \nReset:  To reset as engine generator after a failure while in automatic operation, the engine \nselector switch shall be rotated to the \"stop\" position.  This shall result in resetting the individual \nfail light, but the lockout relay and light shall remain energized.  At this point, the engine may be \noperated for test purposes without danger of being closed onto the bus.  The engine generator \nshall then be returnable to a standby condition by depressing the lockout reset pushbutton on the \nengine generator cubicle door with the engine generator in the \"auto\" or \"run\" position. \n \n2.08 \nLOAD DEMAND SEQUENCE \nA. \nGeneral: After all generator sets have been paralleled to the bus and all loads connected, a 5-\nminute time delay (Load Demand Start Timer, operator adjustable 0-15 minutes) shall be initiated. \n At the expiration of the time delay period, the load demand active light shall turn on, and the \nsystem shall operate in a load demand mode.  The Load Demand Control Logic, and its \nassociated controls, shall control the number of generating sets on the bus, so that the load on \nthe bus is not more than 90% (adjustable), or less than 80% (adjustable), of the capacity of a \nsingle generator set. \n \n\n \nUpon sensing that the connected load has increased to 90% or more (Priority # Engine Start kW \nLevel, operator adjustable 60 - 100%), a 10-second time delay (Priority # Engine Start Timer, \noperator adjustable 0 - 300 seconds) is initiated.  If the load stays above 90% for the duration of \nthe 10-second time delay, the controls shall initiate the starting and paralleling of the next set in \nsequence.  If, during the time delay period, the load increases to more than 120% (fixed), which \nsignifies a bus overload, the time delay shall be bypassed and the next set in sequence shall be \nimmediately started and paralleled.  At the same time, signals shall be given to shed loads so that \nthe connected priority blocks of load are reduced to equal the number of engine generator sets \nonline.  Also, the load demand active light shall go out, and the priority load shed active light shall \nturn on for the effected priority blocks. \n \nWhen the next set is paralleled to the bus, the shed load shall be reconnected and all controls \nautomatically reset. \n \nShould the next set in sequence have its engine control switch in the \"off\" position, or fail to \nsynchronize within the preset time delay of the \"fail-to-synchronize\" timer, the controls shall \nautomatically pass the starting signal to the next set in sequence.  Individual visual and audible \nalarms shall initiate the above conditions. \n \nIf while operating in the load demand mode, an engine generator set malfunction occurs, the \naffected set shall be removed from the bus and load priority blocks shall be shed so the \nremaining priority blocks are equal to the capacity of the remaining engine generators.  All idle \nsets shall be started and paralleled.  As the sets are paralleled, all loads shall be reconnected \nexcept for the last priority block, which cannot be fed when a generator is down.  These loads \nmay be added manually by an operator if it is determined that it shall not overload the system.  \nThe stabilization time delay is energized after all available sets have been connected to the bus, \nand upon its expiration, load demand operation is resumed. \n \nUpon sensing that the load has decreased to 80% or less (Priority # Engine Stop kW Level, \noperator adjustable 40 - 90%), a 180 second) time delay (Priority # Engine Stop Timer, operator \nadjustable 0 - 300 seconds) shall be initiated.  If the load stays below 80% for the duration of the \ntime delay, the circuit breaker of the last set that went online shall be opened.  The engine shall \nrun for its cooldown period, then shutdown. \n \n2.09 \nBUS OPTIMIZATION \nA. \nSequence: If a generator fails while operating in the emergency mode, it is disconnected from the \nbus and shutdown.  The lowest priority loads are shed.  Audible and visual alarms shall be \nactivated to indicate the condition.  With the above conditions, a bus optimization toggle switch \ncan then be turned on. This shall initiate a 5-minute timer (Bus Optimization Start Timer, operator \nadjustable, 0 - 15 minutes).  After a stabilization period,), the system shall examine loads one at a \ntime to determine whether they can be re-added to the emergency bus.  It shall compare the kW \nlevel (ATS kW Level, operator adjustable, 50 kW - single generator kW capacity) of the highest \npriority shed ATS with the highest subpriority value to the amount of excess on-line generator \ncapacity.  If the kW level of the ATS being checked is less than the excess on-line generator \ncapacity, that ATS shall be re-added to the emergency bus.  A 2 second timer (Bus Optimization \nStep Timer, operator adjustable, 1 - 120 seconds) shall then start timing after which the ATS with \nthe next highest subpriority shall then be checked.  This sequence of comparing, adding and \ntiming shall continue until one of the following occurs:  \n \n1. The kW of the ATS being checked is greater than the excess on-line generator capacity.  \nIf this occurs, a light indicates that bus optimization stopped adding.  Bus optimization \nshall continually compare this ATS kW level to the excess on-line generator capacity and \nattempt to add it.   \n\n \n2. The bus has been loaded to 95% of its capacity (Bus Loaded to Capacity kW Level, \noperator adjustable, 60 - 100%). \n-OR- \n3.  Bus Optimization has checked all of the shed ATS\u2019s. \n \nIf at any time the bus is overloaded resulting in the bus frequency dropping to 58 Hz or less for \nmore than two seconds, then all bus optimized loads as well as the lowest priority supported load \nblock connected to the bus are shed.  A status light indicating a \u201cBus Underfrequency\u201d shall be \nactivated and the alarm horn sounded.  The bus overload control is maintained until examined by \nthe plant operator.  After taking appropriate actions, the condition may be reset via the \u201cBus \nUnderfrequency Reset\u201d push-button. \n \nIf at any time the bus optimization switch is turned off or if an additional generator fails, then all \nbus optimized loads shall be shed, and the bus optimization active light shall go out.  If the bus \noptimization switch is turned on, then the bus optimization start timer shall start timing again and \nthe sequence shall start again. \n \n2.10 \nSWITCHGEAR CONSTRUCTION \nA. \nGeneral: \n1. \nMetalclad type construction shall be used in the formation of the housing to provide a rigid \nself-supporting and self-contained free-standing assembly.

Refer to \nattachment 2 of this specification section \nG. \nActive equipment: Active equipment is defined as equipment composed of electronic \ncomponent and electric materials, design to work with power applied to it. Cables are not \nconsidered active equipment. \n1.2 \nINTERPRETATION OF DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS \nA. \nObjective: The intent of the design drawings and specifications is to provide the installer of a \ntechnology system a scope of work for bidding purposes and to make sure different bids \nreceived by the entity holding the bidding for the technology system are at the same level of \nscope for comparison purposes. The drawings and specifications are not intended to show \nevery single element of the project to produce a buyout list for the installer. In general, for all \ntechnology systems, all active components are specifically called out but small wires and small \ninstallation materials (such as nut, bolts, washers, termination blocks, clamps, ties, etc) are not \nindicated in the documents. Guidelines for installation of those systems are provided in the \nspecification to allow the installer to produce the complete buyout list of materials. \nB. \nAccuracy: The Drawings are diagrammatic and are not intended to show exact locations of \nconduit runs, outlet boxes, junction boxes, pull boxes, etc. The locations of equipment, \nappliances, fixtures, conduits, outlets, boxes and similar devices shown on the Drawings are \n\n \napproximate only. Exact locations shall be as accepted by the Architect or Engineer during \nconstruction. Obtain in the field all information relevant to the placing of technology systems \nwork and in case of interference with other work, proceed as directed by the Architect or \nEngineer. \nC. \nDistances: Although most drawings have a scale referenced on each sheet, the drawings are a \ntwo dimensional representation of the system, so design drawings do not indicate changes in \nelevation that cause additional lengths and quantities of materials. It is the responsibility of the \ninstaller of each technology system to field verify all distances before bidding to properly \nestimate all cable distances and materials. \nD. \nDiscrepancies: Notify the A&E of any discrepancies found during construction of the project and \ndo not proceed with that portion of the project, until a written definitive statement is received \nproviding clear direction. If a conflict exists between the contract documents and any applicable \ncode or standard, the most stringent requirement shall be included for this project. The Engineer \nshall make the decision regarding questionable areas of conflict. \nE. \nExisting Conditions: All existing conditions might not be indicated in the design drawings. The \ninstaller of each system shall check site and existing conditions thoroughly before bidding and \nadvice the Engineer of discrepancies prior to bid. \nF. \nCoordination: Although design technology drawings were intended to be coordinated with other \ntrades, the fact that installer for other non-technology system might have changes to their \ndesign drawings, requires the Contractor to produce coordination drawings for a specific space, \nincluding all elements of all trades for space planning and coordination purposes. \n1.3 \nABBREVIATIONS \nA. \nAbbreviations: The following abbreviations or initials may be used: \n1. \nABV CLG - Above Ceiling \n2. \nAC - Alternating Current \n3. \nADA - American Disabilities Act \n4. \nAFF - Above Finished Floor \n5. \nAFG - Above Finished Grade \n6. \nAMP - Ampere \n7. \nANSI - American National Standards Institute \n8. \nAWG - American Wire Gauge \n9. \nBC - Bare Copper \n10. \nCCTV - Closed Circuit Television \n11. \nCATV - Community antenna television \n12. \nCLG - Ceiling \n13. \nCOAX - Coaxial Cable \n14. \nCPU - Central Processing Unit \n15. \nDC - Direct Current \n16. \nDEG - Degree \n17. \nEMT \u2013 Electrical Metallic Tubing \n18. \nGND - Ground \n19. \nIDF - Intermediate Distribution Frame (Telecom Room) \n20. \nIMC - Intermediate Metallic Conduit \n21. \nIN - Inches \n22. \nIP - Internet Protocol \n23. \nJB - Junction Box \n24. \nKVA - Kilo-Volt-Amps \n\n \n26. \nLBS - Pounds \n27. \nLED - Light Emitting Diode \n28. \nMAX - Maximum \n29. \nMDF - Main Distribution Frame (Main Telecom Room) \n30. \nMIC - Microphone \n31. \nMIN - Minimum \n32. \nMTD - Mounted \n33. \nMTG - Mounting \n34. \nNEC - National Electrical Code \n35. \nNECA - National Electrical Contractors Association \n36. \nNEMA - National Electrical Manufacturers Association \n37. \nNFPA - National Fire Protection Association \n38. \nNIC - Not in Contract \n39. \nOFE - Owner furnished equipment \n40. \nOSHA - Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n41. \nPB - Pullbox \n42. \nPWR - Power \n43. \nPVC - Polyvinylchloride \n44. \nEF - Telecommunications Entrance Facility \n45. \nTR - Telecommunications Room \n46. \nTTB - Telephone Terminal Board \n47. \nV - Volt \n48. \nWP - Weatherproof \n1.4 \nCODES AND STANDARDS \nA. \nApplication: The codes, standards and practices listed herein generally apply to the entire \nproject and all technology systems.
