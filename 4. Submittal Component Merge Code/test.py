PART 3 - EXECUTION
3.01
NON-CONTINUOUS CABLE SUPPORT SYSTEMS
A.
Follow manufacturer’s instructions and recommended industry standards and guidelines 
for installation. 
  
B.
The installed non-continuous support system must be an independent support structure 
for the communications system.
C.
Draping cables over other structures in the ceiling is unacceptable.  Water pipes, ceiling 
grid, sprinkler system, electrical supports, air ducts or any other in-ceiling structure may 
not be used for cable support. 
D.
Non-continuous supports shall be used to supplement the main cable support system 
when any cabling leaves the main support system or is unsupported for more than three 
and one half feet (3’-6”).   
E.
Non-continuous supports shall be installed with ceiling wire or threaded rod secured to 
the slab above to support the communications cable infrastructure parallel to the slab 
throughout the cable plant, unless site conditions dictate a non-parallel installation.   
F.
Non-continuous supports must be routed to follow existing corridors and parallel or 90 
degree angles from all walls and the cable tray whenever possible.
G.
Non-continuous support system is a method of supporting horizontal network cabling 
between the communications intermediate distribution rooms (IDFs) and the work area 
outlet where cable tray assemblies are not installed.
H.
Non-continuous support system shall consist of a scalable pathway system able to 
accommodate a 50% increase in future cable counts.
I.
Under no circumstances shall the non-continuous support pathway be obstructed by 
other structural obstructions for example, fire sprinkler pipes, mechanical ductwork, 
structural beams, electrical junction boxes and/or conduits, ceilings etc.
J.
Under no circumstances shall the non-continuous supports be spaced further than the 
allowed 4’-0” or at such intervals as to allow cable bundles supported to rest on any 
structural obstructions for example, fire sprinkler pipes, mechanical ductwork, structural 
beams, electrical junction boxes and/or conduits, ceilings etc.
K.
The non-continuous support system shall at all times allow for EIA/TIA standards 
compliant cable bend radii to accommodate copper and fiber station cabling.
WSP B2115173.000
L.
The non-continuous supports system shall be installed in a structured grid pattern 
perpendicular to the existing cable tray pathways and shall make use of a modular 
assembly method to support a scalable pathway system for future needs.
M.
Cable bundles inside the non-continuous supports system shall at all times be bundled 
neatly to lay inside the hook system with no excessive cable slack or loop overhang.
N.
The non-continuous supports system shall be suspended off ¼” threaded rod supported 
off the slab above with approved anchors. Provide bracing wires and steel straps at 
minimum every 25’, at all directional changes in the non-continuous support system 
pathway and at all intersections of the non-continuous support system pathways.
O.
Other approved methods of supporting the non-continuous supports are with structural 
beam clamps, flange clips, C and Z purlin clips.
P.
Installation and configuration shall conform to the requirements of ANSI/TIA-568-C.0, 
ANSI/TIA-568-C.1 & ANSI/TIA-569-B, NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code), applicable 
local codes, and to the manufacturer's installation instructions.
Q.
Install cables using techniques, practices, and methods that are consistent with Category 
5e or higher requirements and that supports Category 5e or higher performance of 
completed and linked signal paths, end to end.
R.
Install cables without damaging conductors, shield, or jacket.
S.
Do not bend cables, in handling or in installing, to smaller radii than minimums 
recommended by manufacturer.
T.
Pull cables without exceeding cable manufacturer's recommended pulling tensions.  Use 
pulling means that will not damage media.
U.
Do not exceed load ratings specified by manufacturer.
V.
Adjustable non-continuous support sling shall have a static load limit of 100 lbs.
W.

STRUCTURAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS
A.
Slotted strut supports
1.
Leftover construction dust, metal filings and debris from drilling, cutting, sawing 
and any other construction activity can be detrimental to electronic equipment in 
production communications room environments. The Contractor shall be required 
to place dust protective plastic covers at all times over HVAC systems, UPS 
power systems and any other equipment or furniture that is occupying the space 
during construction when the Contractor is doing construction work in the 
immediate vicinity of this equipment. This will prevent dust, metal filings and 
debris collection in the equipment during construction. Dust protection covers to 
be approved by the Owner prior to installation.
