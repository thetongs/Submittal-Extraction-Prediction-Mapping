INSTALLATION OF PIPE AND FITTINGS - INTERIOR Install Schedule 40 steel pipe with cut or rolled grooved ends and grooved mechanical couplings.  Piping under 2\" may utilize threaded connections. Install Schedule 10 steel pipe with roll-grooved ends and grooved mechanical couplings for pipe sizes 2” and above. Exposed sprinkler piping in process areas shall have threaded or welded connections.  Exposed threads shall be limited to one thread.', '3.2. PIPING INSTALLATIONS Locations and Arrangements:  In general run piping: • Install sprinkler piping to provide for system drainage in accordance with NFPA 13. • Provide 2” main drain valves at system valves and route 2” drains to approved drain locations. • Install mechanical sleeve seal at piping penetrations in outside walls and structural walls. • Use approved fittings to make all changes in direction, branch takeoffs from mains, and reductions in pipe sizes. • Install unions in pipes 2\" and smaller, adjacent to each valve.  Unions are not required on flanged devices or in piping installations using grooved mechanical couplings. • Coordinate sprinkler pipe routing, sprinkler heads and smoke detector locations with all other trades, including HVAC ductwork, lighting, process and plumbing piping, etc.  Where a conflict exists between sprinkler piping and ductwork, process and/or plumbing piping, the sprinkler piping shall be offset to avoid the conflict. • Sprinkler heads shall be installed in the center of a ceiling tile whenever possible.  In general sprinkler heads shall be installed to provide a uniform ceiling appearance whenever possible. Hangers and Supports:  Comply with the latest requirements of NFPA 13 and NFPA 14.  Hanger and support spacing and locations for piping joined with grooved mechanical couplings shall be in accordance with the grooved mechanical coupling manufacturer\\'s written instructions, for rigid systems.  Provide protection from damage where subject to earthquake in accordance with NFPA 13. Hangers and Supports for Clean Manufacturing or Support Areas:  Hangers and supports for exposed sprinkler piping in these areas shall meet FDA sanitary requirements for cleanability. Make connections between underground and above-ground piping using an approved transition piece strapped or fastened to prevent separation. Install test connections sized and located in accordance with NFPA 13 complete with shutoff valve.  Test connections may also serve as drain pipes. PAGE : 6 Install pressure gauge on the riser or feed main at or near each test connection.  Provide gauge with a connection not less than 1/4\" and having a soft metal seated globe valve, arranged for draining pipe between gauge and valve. Install gauges to permit removal, and where they will not be subject to freezing. Install wall or ceiling escutcheons where exposed sprinkler piping passes through ceilings or walls.', '3.3. PIPE JOINT CONSTRUCTION Welded Joints:  AWS D10.9, Level AR-3. Threaded Joints:  Conform to ANSI B1.20.1-1983 (R2001), tapered pipe threads for field cut threads.  Join pipe, fittings, and valves as follows: • Note the internal length of threads in fittings or valve ends, and proximity of internal seat or wall, to determine how far pipe should be threaded into joint. • Align threads at point of assembly. • Apply appropriate tape or thread compound to the external pipe threads. • Assemble joint to appropriate thread depth.  When using a wrench on valves place the wrench on the valve end into which the pipe is being threaded. Damaged Threads:  Do not use pipe with threads that are corroded or damaged.  If a weld opens during cutting or threading operations, that portion of pipe shall not be used. Flanged Joints:  Align flanges surfaces parallel.  Assemble joints by sequencing bolt tightening to make initial contact of flanges and gaskets as flat and parallel as possible.  Use suitable lubricants on bolt threads.  Tighten bolts gradually and uniformly to appropriate torque specified by the bolt manufacturer. Mechanical Grooved Joints:  Cut or roll grooves on pipe ends dimensionally compatible with the couplings. End Treatment:  After cutting pipe lengths, remove burrs and fins from pipe ends. Plain end fittings shall not be used.', \"3.4. VALVE INSTALLATIONS General:  Install fire protection specialty valves, fittings, and specialties in accordance with the manufacturer's written instructions, NFPA 13and the authority having jurisdiction. Valves:  Install supervised-open gate or butterfly valves so located to control all sources of water supply except fire department connections.  Where there is more than one control valve, provide permanently marked identification signs indicating the portion of the system controlled by each valve. Install flow switches in each zone as indicated on the drawings. Install check valves in each water supply connection. Alarm Check Valves:  Install valves in the vertical position, in proper direction of flow including the bypass check valve and retard chamber drain line connection.  Install valve trim in accordance with the valve manufacturer's appropriate trim diagram.  Test valve for proper operation.\", '3.5. SPRINKLER HEAD INSTALLATIONS Provide clean room style sprinkler heads in clean rooms, rooms with hard gypsum ceilings, cold rooms, and elsewhere as indicated. Do not seal clean room cover, seal sprinkler enclosure above ceiling. PAGE : 7 Use proper tools to prevent damage during installations. Install per installation requirements indicated by NFPA 13.', '3.6. FIELD QUALITY CONTROL Flush, test, and inspect sprinkler piping systems in accordance with NFPA 13. Piping Tests:  Conduct piping tests before joints are covered, and after thrust blocks have sufficiently hardened for underground piping.  Fill pipeline with water 24 hours prior to testing and apply test pressure to stabilize system. Hydrostatic Tests:  Test at not less than 200 psi for two (2) hours or at 50 psi above maximum static pressure if it is greater than 150 psi. Increase pressure in 50 psi increments and inspect each joint between increments.  Hold at test pressure for one (1) hour, decrease to zero (0) psi.  Slowly increase again to test pressure and hold for one (1) more hour. Operating Tests:  Open and close all valves under system water pressure. Replace piping system components, which do not pass the test procedures specified, and retest repaired portion of the system.', '3.7. ADJUSTING AND CLEANING Flushing:  Flush underground mains, lead-in connections to sprinkler risers, and system piping before connection is made to sprinklers, or other fire protection system piping. Flush at flow rate not less than that indicated in NFPA 24, or at hydraulically calculated water demand rate of the system, whichever is greater.', '3.8. IDENTIFICATION SIGNS Provide all necessary identification signs for piping, control valves, main drain valves, auxiliary drains, test drains and all other signs which may be required by NFPA or FM requirements. Refer to Specification 200553 Tagging and Identification for pipe labeling requirements.']\n"
