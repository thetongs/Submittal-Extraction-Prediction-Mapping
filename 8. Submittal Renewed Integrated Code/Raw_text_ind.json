Route piping at right angles or parallel to the building structure, free \nof sags or bends, and grouped together wherever possible.  Locate groups of pipes parallel to each other, spaced \nto permit applying full insulation and servicing of valves.  Diagonal runs are not permitted, unless expressly \nindicated on the drawings or approved isometric. \n \nArrange piping to allow for ease of access to components that will be serviced regularly as part of the intended \noperation of the equipment, including the removal of filter housings and valve actuators, and the calibration of \ninstrumentation.  Where piping is installed in clean manufacturing areas, sufficient space between piping (or \ninsulation on insulated piping) shall be provided to allow for cleaning and shall not be less than 1\u201d. \n \nArrange supports and piping directional changes to allow for thermal expansion in the piping systems due to \nnormal temperature changes.  Avoid creating, even temporarily, undue loads, forces, or strains on valves, \ninstrumentation, equipment connections, supports, structural framing, or building components caused by piping \nconnections or supports. \n \nAllow sufficient space above removable ceiling panels to allow for panel removal. \n \nProvide equipment connections with hygienic clamps, compression end, flanged, or threaded connections with \nunions, based upon the piping material and system, unless otherwise indicated, to allow for complete removal of \nthe equipment without disruption of the connected piping system. \n \nInstall drains at low points in piping mains, risers, and branch lines consisting of valve types per section 2.5 of \nthis specification and the system data sheets.  Provide caps at ends of valves. \n \nInstall air vents at high points of hydronic systems for system air venting, unless otherwise specified. \n \n \nInstall final piping, unions, and flanges at connections to all equipment and fixtures in such a manner that will \npermit the complete removal of any fixtures or components, such as coils, tube bundles, or filters without cutting \npipelines (e.g., through the uses of swing elbows). \n \nInstall instrumentation and other control devices in piping systems where indicated on the drawings. \n \n3.1.2. \nP&ID Drawings \n \nWhen Process and Instrumentation Diagrams are provided, they shall be adhered to as much as possible and \npractical, as they indicate the desired relative locations of piping components, flow paths, and equipment \nconnections to achieve the proper process operations.  Where conflicts arise between the P&IDs and other \ndrawings and specifications, notify the Owner and Owner\u2019s representative for clarification. \n \n3.1.3. \nPiping Plan and Elevation Drawings \n \nWhen piping plan and elevation drawings are provided, they indicate the general location and arrangement of the \npiping systems and associated valves and components.  Location and arrangement of piping layout take into \nconsideration pipe sizing and friction loss, thermal expansion, pump sizing, and other design considerations.  To \nthe extent possible and practical, install piping as indicated.   \n \n3.1.4. \nPipe Penetrations \n \nInstall sleeves for piping passing through penetrations in floors, partitions, roofs and walls.  Cut sleeves to length \nfor mounting flush with both surfaces, unless otherwise indicated on drawings.   \n\u2022 \nPiping 6\u201d and smaller shall use pipe sleeves; piping larger than 6\u201d shall use sheet-metal sleeves.  \n\u2022 \nSelect sleeves of size large enough to provide 1\u201d annular clear space between pipe or pipe insulation and \nconcrete slabs and walls. \n\u2022 \nSelect sleeves of size large enough to provide \u00bc\u201d annular clear space between pipe or pipe insulation \nand interior partitions. \n\u2022 \nSeal annular space between sleeve and piping or piping insulation; use joint sealants appropriate for size, \ndepth, and location of joint. \n\u2022 \nPiping located in exterior walls below grade shall use mechanical-sleeve-seal. \n \nAll pipe penetrations through clean room walls and ceilings, including all clean manufacturing spaces, shall be \nsealed using clean room wall/ceiling pipe penetration boots.  Boots shall be installed on the pipe on the clean \nroom side of the penetration, prior to the addition of valves and fittings that would prevent the installation of the \nboot and final positioning against the penetration.  Where pipes penetrate a wall between 2 clean rooms, a boot \nshall be installed on both side of the wall, and piping insulation installed between the boots to completely insulate \nthe pipe. \n \nAll pipe penetrations through non-clean room walls and ceilings shall be provided with an escutcheon on each \nside of the wall.  The penetration shall be sealed with insulation and sealant.  Install sealants by proven techniques \nthat result in sealants directly contacting joints edges, completely filling recesses provided for each joint \nconfiguration, and providing uniform, cross sectional shapes and depths relative to joint widths which allow \noptimum sealant movement capability. \n \nThe smallest size boot that can adequately seal the pipe to the wall/ceiling surface shall be used.  Pipes shall be \nspaced to prevent interference between the boot ceiling rings of adjacent pipes.  No sealant shall be used between \nthe boot and the wall/ceiling surface. \n \nWhere fire stop sealants are required to meet applicable codes for pipe penetrations through fire rated walls and \nceilings, the sealants shall be applied to the penetration prior to the attachment of the boot or escutcheon to the \nwall/ceiling surface. \n \n \nsheathing on the clean room side tight to the ceiling and cut it back on the dirty side to allow the insulation to be \nextended tight to the inside of the boot.   \n \nIf pipe is insulated the insulation shall be continuous through the escutcheon in non-clean room areas. \n \n3.1.5. \nPreparation \n \nPrepare piping, joints and fittings in accordance with AWS procedures. \n \nKeep all openings in piping, components and equipment closed during construction, except when actual work is \nbeing performed on that item or system. \n \n3.1.6. \nFittings \n \nMake reductions in pipe sizes using reducer fittings. Eccentric reducers shall be used for all steam, condensate, \nand critical liquid systems, installed with the straight side down unless indicated otherwise.  Vertical lines shall \nuse concentric reducer fittings. \n \nUse fittings for all changes in direction and all branch connections except where bending is specifically allowed \nby the piping material data sheet.  Use long radius elbows unless indicated otherwise, or unless required due to \nspace constraints. \n \n3.1.7. \nBranch Connections \n \nBranch connection types shall comply with branch connection tables in the piping material data sheets.  \nOrientations of branches shall comply with the following requirements: \n \nLiquids:   Take-off from top, bottom, or side of mains or headers at either 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 from horizontal \nplane. \nGases:   \nTake-off from top of mains or headers at either 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 from horizontal plane. \nSteam:   \nTake off from top of mains at either 45\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 from horizontal plane, or as indicated on \nthe drawings.  Take off at 45\u00b0 from horizontal plane is preferred. \n \n3.1.8. \nConnections and Joints \n \nAll piping connections and joints shall be made in accordance with appropriate ASME B31 Piping Code sections.  \nThe types of joints and connections in a piping system shall be as indicated on the drawings and elsewhere in the \nproject specifications.  Welded joints are preferred and shall be used wherever possible and practical, complying \nwith AWS procedures and standards. \n \nJoints indicated as being soldered on copper systems may be brazed on larger sizes if the contractor believes a \nbetter joint will be the result.  Brazed joints shall be in accordance with AWS standards C3.3, C3.4, C5.10, and \nD10.13.  Filler material shall be AWS A5.8 BCuP-5 silver copper-phosphorus (15% Ag, 80% Cu, 5% P, nominal \ncomposition), and shall otherwise meet the material requirements indicated for that system on the piping data \nsheet (e.g., lead free for potable water systems).  This approach shall be submitted for approval per system prior \nto use. \n \nAt the final connection to each piece of equipment, adjacent to each control valve or where indicated on drawings, \ninstall flanges in piping 2\u00bd\u201d and larger and unions in piping 2\u201d and smaller.   \n \nAssemble flange joints by sequencing bolt tightening to make initial contact of flanges and gaskets as flat and \nparallel as possible.  Tighten bolts gradually to uniformly compress the gaskets and minimize flange stress. Use \na calibrated torque wrench to tighten flange and flange bolts to torque specified by manufacturer. \n \n \nare the only ones available, raised face shall be removed by grinding to a smooth flat surface prior to assembly of \nthe joint. \n \n3.1.9. \nValves \n \nLocate valves for easy access and provide separate support where necessary.  Install valves in horizontal piping \nwith stem at or above the center of the pipe, when possible.  In all cases install valves to allow for easy access for \noperation.  Install valves in a position to allow full stem movement.  Protect valves that will be welded, soldered \nor brazed into piping systems from heat damage. \n \nValves that have automated actuators or that can be disassembled for maintenance without removal from the \nconnected piping system shall be installed in such a manner that will allow removal of the actuator or serviceable \ncomponents without disturbing surrounding systems. \n \nInstall valves and unions for each fixture and equipment item arranged to allow equipment removal without \nsystem shut down.  A union connection shall be installed as close as possible to each screwed or soldered end \nvalve. \n \nInstall check valves as indicated on the drawings, and for proper direction of flow, oriented to ensure that the \nvalve will close freely and positively under normal operating conditions.

The system shall then be re-\npressurized with dry nitrogen or compressed air and maintained at 3-5 psig until the system is made operational. \n \n3.2. \nASME BPE SYSTEM PIPING SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS \n \n3.2.1. \nGeneral \n \nComply with all current GMP guidelines and ASME BPE recommendations and requirements, as well as \nrequirements indicated in this specification, in the layout, design, fabrication, documentation, inspection and \ntesting of ASME BPE piping systems.   \n \nDead legs shall be minimized or eliminated if possible and practical, and no vertical, downward oriented dead \nlegs will be allowed.  Piping runs shall be configured to minimize hold up volume. \n \nPiping supports shall be employed and configured to rigidly support and reinforce the piping and installed \ncomponents, and to provide for consistent drainability to the designated low points in the system.  All ASME \nBPE system piping shall be sloped a minimum of 1/8\u201d but 1/4\u201d is preferred or as identified on P&IDs and \ndrawings.  The direction of slope shall follow the process flow path unless indicated otherwise on the drawings. \n \n3.2.2. \nFittings and Joints \n \nWelded joints are preferred and shall be used wherever possible and practical.  Hygienic clamp joints shall be \nused to connect to equipment and instrumentation, and to provide break away points to facilitate service of \nequipment and pipeline components.  Valves shall be welded to the piping system wherever possible and practical, \nunless indicated otherwise on the drawings. \n \nButt weld extended tangent fittings are preferred and shall be used wherever possible and practical.  If fittings \nwith shorter lengths, and hence less hold up volume, can be used with automated orbital welders, they can be used \nwhere necessary to improve system configuration. \n \nHand welds may be used only when absolutely necessary.  All proposed hand welds shall be submitted to the \nOwner for approval, including the qualifications of the welder performing the welds.  Weld coupons on tubing of \nthe same size as the hand weld shall be submitted before and after each hand weld for review and approval. \n \n3.2.3. \nMinimum Distance \n \nWhere indicated on the drawings, Minimum Distance (MIN DIST, Fitting Bound or Fitting Tight) is defined as \nwelded connections using standard fittings, valves, instruments and components, end to end with no additional \nspool pieces or fittings.  The Owner or Owner\u2019s representative will only allow additional spool pieces or fittings \nafter review and approval. \n \n3.2.4. \nValves \n \nUse pre-fabricated valve assemblies whenever practical and feasible in order to minimize or eliminate dead legs \nand hand welds. \n \n \nSterile access valve assemblies shall be configured and oriented so that both flow paths are in the horizontal and \nlevel allowing for direction of slope, and both valves of the assembly shall be completely drainable after final \ninstallation. \n \nZero static tee valves shall be used wherever possible and practical, and as indicated on the drawings, as isolation \nvalves for branch lines.  Valves shall be configured and installed to provide for complete drainability. \n \n3.3. \nQUALITY CONTROL \n \n3.3.1. \nPressure Testing \n \nGeneral \n \nAfter the completion of all welding, fabrication and polishing operations, but prior to insulating, all piping systems \nshall be pressure tested using the test procedure as indicated within the Piping System Application Table (PSAT) \nand as specified herein.    No testing shall be performed without being witnessed by the Owner or the Owner\u2019s \nrepresentative, who shall be notified 48 hours in advance of the test.  Owner reserves the right to decline to witness \nthe pressure testing.  All testing procedures shall be approved by the Owner prior to the start of testing.  All testing \nprocedures and acceptance criteria must satisfy the corresponding code indicated in the PSAT per system. \n \nEquipment, instruments and components that are not rated for the test pressure shall be isolated from the piping \nsystem during pressure tests.  If a valve is used to isolate components, its closure shall be capable of sealing \nagainst the test pressure without damage to the isolated component. \nProvide temporary restraints for expansion joints which cannot sustain the reactions due to test pressure.  If \ntemporary restraints are not practical, isolate expansion joints from testing. \n \nJoints at which blinds are inserted to isolate equipment need not be tested. \n \nIn each system to be tested, install relief valves set at a pressure of no more than 1/3 higher than the test pressure \nto protect against damage by expansion of liquid or other source of overpressure during the test. \n \nRefer to the Piping System Applications Table (PSAT) for the type of fluid to be used as the pressure testing \nmedium.    Compressed air and/or nitrogen for all pneumatic pressure tests shall be of the quality as described in \nSection 3.1.12 under Preparation.  The pressure testing apparatus shall be constructed of materials that are \ncompatible with the piping system and components being tested.  Test apparatus for ASME BPE system piping \nshall be constructed of stainless steel or polymeric and shall leave no mineral deposits or other trace residue in \nthe piping system. \n \nSoap solutions utilized for visual examination of pneumatically pressure tested piping systems shall be a \ncommercial preparation made specifically for leak detection.  Soap solutions used on ASME BPE piping systems \nconstructed of stainless steel shall be low chloride type. \n \nProvide a temporary test pump, storage tank and other accessories as required to achieve the test pressures \nspecified where not available on site. \n \nTest Pressures \n \nRefer to the attached Piping System Applications Table for the piping system test pressure to be used.   \n \nTest Acceptance \n \nA test will be considered acceptable when all of the conditions of this specification have been met and the test \npressure does not change more than 2.0% during the stated test duration.  It is required that an Owner designated \nrepresentative be present to witness and sign for test acceptance. \n \nProvide pressure test documentation including: \n \nDate of test \nIdentification of piping system tested. \nTest fluid \nTest pressure \nTest results \nIdentities of Test Witnesses \n \nHydrostatic Testing Procedure \n \n1. With written approval by Owner, prior to hydrostatic pressure testing, the Contractor has the option to \nperform a low pressure pneumatic pressure test.  If the Contractor wishes to perform this preliminary \ntest, Steps 1 through 4 shall be followed from the \u201cPneumatic Testing Procedure\u201d outlined below.  Upon \ncompletion of a successful leak check at the pressure in Step 4, the system shall be released of pressure \nand the remaining steps for Hydrostatic Testing Procedure shall be performed.  For this preliminary test, \nContractor shall utilize particulate, moisture and oil free air or nitrogen gas of qualities as described in \nSection 3.1.12 under Preparation. \n \n2. Fill the piping system with appropriate water from a storage tank or other approved source.  Owner or \nOwner's representative shall approve water quality and source for use with hydrostatic pressure tests. \n \n3. Bleed the system of entrained gases. \n \n4. Circulate the water through the system using a circulating pump for a period of not less than one hour. \n \n5. Inspect all piping for leaks during circulation of water. \n \n6. Slowly close a temporary valve on the discharge side of the piping system. \n \n7. When the test pressure is obtained at the discharge of the pump, the pump shall be shut down and the \ndischarge valve closed.  If the circulation pump is not capable of producing the test pressure required for \nthe piping system, provisions shall be made for pressurizing the water filled system with particulate, \nmoisture and oil free air or nitrogen gas of a quality as defined in Section 3.1.12 under Preparation, or a \nhand pump. \n \n8. Leaks shall be marked and repaired according to the joining methods specified for the piping system \nbeing tested. \n \n9. After leaks are repaired, the entire system shall be tested again as specified above. \n \n10. Repeat test procedure until the system is proven tight at test pressure to the satisfaction of the Owner or \nOwner's Representative. \n \n11. Hydrostatic test pressure shall be maintained for a sufficient length of time to visually determine whether \nthere are any leaks, but not less than 1 hour.  The Contractor shall not be required to maintain test pressure \nin excess of 2 hours after notification of the Owner\u2019s authorized inspector. \n \n12. If start up is not scheduled to occur within 12 hours after hydrostatic testing, the system shall be \ncompletely drained and purged with clean, filtered oil-free, dry air. \n \nPneumatic Testing Procedure \n \n1. Clear the test area of non-essential personnel before bringing the line pressure up to test pressure.  The \n \npneumatic testing as this testing procedure is inherently dangerous. \n \n2. A pressure relief device shall be provided, having a set pressure not higher than the test pressure plus the \nlesser of 50 psig or 10% of the test pressure. \n \n3. A double block and bleed valve arrangement shall be included in the pressurizing line to the system \nbeing tested.  A test gauge shall be located downstream of the double block valve assembly.   \n \n4. When pneumatic testing over 25 psig, a preliminary check at 10 psig shall be made to locate major leaks.  \nExamination of the system may be visual or audible.  Visual examinations shall utilize a soap solution \nin order to detect the leakage.   \n \n5. After the preliminary check, the test pressure shall be increased in stages of not more than 25% up to \nfull pneumatic test pressure, allowing time for equalization of strains and detection of leaks at each stage.   \nIf after a minimum 10-minute period the pressure is held, proceed to the next pressure.   \n \n6. If the pressure is not held, examine the entire system for leakage.  Examination of the system shall be \nvisual utilizing a soap solution to detect the leakage.  All leaks found shall be marked and repaired after \nfirst depressurizing the line.  After leaks have been repaired, the pressure test shall be repeated.  All leaks \nwhich have been repaired shall be visually reexamined, with soap, to assure proper repair.   \n \n7. After the system has been successfully brought up to the test pressure, the pressure shall then be held for \na 10-minute period.  After this period, the pressure shall be reduced to the design pressure and held for \na duration of 24 hours.    \n \n8. Bolting shall not be tightened while systems are being tested above 30 psig. \n \n3.3.2. \nWeld/Brazing Inspections \n \nGeneral \n \nWelds and brazed connections shall be inspected per the applicable ASME code identified in the PSAT per \nsystem.  Inspections shall be performed and documented by a qualified 3rd party, separate from the installation \ncontractor.  Welds and brazed connections that do not pass inspection shall be removed from the system.  If \nASME BPE is indicated in the PSAT, then Chapter X of ASME B31.3 is implied for weld and/or brazed \ninspection.  For piping systems indicated as ASME B31.3 or ASME BPE, utilize the appropriate chapter based \non the classified fluid service indicated in the PSAT. \n \nThe interior of all welds or brazing performed in a shop environment shall be inspected. \n \nASME BPE Specific Requirements \n \nExaminations shall be performed and documented by the installation contractor per BPE. \n \nThe exterior of all welds shall be visually examined by a Level II qualified inspector and documented in the weld \nlog.   \n \nWelds that do not pass examinations shall either be removed from the system or re-welded in accordance with \nthe latest version of the ASME BPE. \n \nInspections shall be performed and documented by a qualified 3rd party, separate from the installation contractor.  \nIf ASME BPE is indicated in the PSAT, then Chapter X of ASME B31.3 is implied for weld inspection.  For \npiping systems indicated as ASME B31.3, utilize the appropriate chapter based on the classified fluid service \nindicated in the PSAT. \n \nThe interior of welded joints shall be inspected using a borescope.  All borescope inspections shall be \nelectronically recorded, and copies of the recordings shall be provided to the Owner.  Welds that do not pass \nexaminations shall either be removed from the system or re-welded in accordance with the latest version of ASME \nBPE. \n \nThe inspection plan by the inspection contractor shall include no less than 20% borescope of the welds in each \nsystem installed.  Initially, the interior of all welds performed in the field shall be inspected.  After an individual \nwelder performs 25 consecutive welds with no rejections, the weld interior inspection rate may be reduced to the \nminimum agreed upon with Owner but no less than 20%.  Each of the minimum 20% borescope welds shall have \nvideo capture as documentation of that inspected weld.  Upon rejection of any weld, the weld interior inspection \nrate shall increase to all welds, and the accepted weld count shall be reset to zero. \n \nIf it is physically impossible to perform a borescope inspection of a weld, an actual configuration coupon (butt-\nbutt coupon) weld just prior to and after completing the blind weld shall be performed, and subsequently inspected \nfor approval or rejection by the weld inspector. \n \nThe interior of brazed joints shall be direct visual inspected per BPE code.  The Owner and Contractor shall agree \nupon a minimum percentage of brazed joints for inspection. \n \n3.3.3. \nWeld/Brazing Examinations \n \nAll piping system examinations shall satisfy the applicable code as indicated in the PSAT and shall be performed \nby the installation contractor.   \n \n \nEND OF SECTION \nInsulation Index\nTemperature (\u00b0F)\nPipe Elastomer Type\nRef.

Penetrate slab using rigid metal, refer \nto Section 3.2 for corrosion protection. \n \nExposed:  Rigid metal conduit up to 10\u2019 above finished floor, Electrical metallic tubing above 10\u2019.  Use \nrigid metal conduit or intermediate metal conduit for all sizes larger than 4\u2019\u2019.    \n \nExposed in Clean Rooms:  Stainless steel rigid conduit or PVC coated rigid metal conduit, liquid tight \nflexible conduit limited to 18\u201d for final connections. \n \n \nConcealed (Above Grade):  Electrical metallic tubing up to 4\", or rigid metal conduit for sizes larger \nthan 4\". \n \nWet or Damp Locations:  Galvanized rigid metal conduit. \n \nConnection from Lighting Fixtures to Branch Circuit Junction Boxes:  Flexible metal conduit not to \nexceed 6'-0\". \n \nConnection to Vibrating Equipment:  Including transformers and hydraulic, pneumatic, or electric \nsolenoid or motor-operated equipment.  \n \nDry Locations:  Flexible metal conduit. \n \nWhere Subject to Water Spray or Dripping Oil, Grease, or Water:  Liquid-tight flexible metal \nconduit. \n \nWireways: NEMA 1 \n \nFittings and junction boxes utilized on color systems shall be colored identically to raceway coloring. \n \n \n3.2. \nINSTALLATION \n \nGeneral:  Install electrical raceways in accordance with manufacturer's written installation instructions, applicable \nrequirements of NEC, and as follows: \n \nMinimum size for all conduits shall be 3/4\" trade size. \n \nNEC type AC, MC, and NM cables are expressly prohibited and shall not be used.  \n \nPull boxes shall be installed in each conduit run every 100\u2019 \u2013 150\u2019; and no greater distance than 150\u2019. \n \nThe maximum number of bends in any single run of conduit shall not exceed 360\u00b0 (4-90\u00b0) per NEC. All feeder \nraceways shall not exceed 270\u00b0 of bends between pull boxes. \n \nKeep raceways at least 6\" away from parallel runs of flues and steam or hot water pipes.  Install raceways level \nand square and at proper elevations. \n \nComplete installation of electrical raceways before starting installation of conductors within raceways. \n \nProvide supports for raceways per National Electrical Code.  Conduit shall not be fastened to or supported from \nductwork, piping, lay-in ceiling support wires, mechanical equipment, or other conduit.  \n \nProvide adequate seismic bracing for all raceways as required by the project. \n \nPrevent foreign matter from entering raceways by using temporary closure protection. \n \nMake bends and offsets so the inside diameter is not effectively reduced.  Unless otherwise indicated, keep the \nlegs of a bend in the same plane and the straight legs of offsets parallel. \n \nUse raceway fittings that are of types compatible with the associated raceway and suitable for the use and location.   \n \nThe use of conduit bodies shall be limited where possible. Where necessary to use conduit bodies, use LB fittings \nfor conduits up to 2 inches. For fittings on conduits sized larger than 2 inches, mogul units shall be installed. \n \n \nRun concealed raceways with a minimum of bends in the shortest practical distance considering the type of \nbuilding construction and obstructions except as otherwise indicated.  This does not apply to conduits in crawl \nspaces. \n \nInstall exposed raceways parallel and perpendicular to nearby surfaces or structural members and follow the \nsurface contours as much as practical. \n \nRun exposed, parallel, or banked raceways together.  Make bends in parallel or banked runs from the same \ncenterline so that the bends are parallel.  Factory elbows may be used in banked runs only where they can be \ninstalled parallel.  This requires that there be a change in the plane of the run such as from wall to ceiling and that \nthe raceways are of the same size.  In other cases, provide field bends for parallel raceways. \n \nJoin raceways with fittings designed and approved for the purpose.  Make raceway terminations tight.  Tighten \nsetscrews of threadless fittings with suitable tool. \n \nWhere subject to vibration or dampness, use insulating bushings to protect conductors and bonding bushings or \nwedges to assure electrical continuity of the raceway. \n \nElevation of Raceway:  Where possible, install horizontal raceway runs above water and steam piping. \n \nRaceways Embedded in Slabs:  Install in middle third of the slab thickness where practical and leave at least 1\" \nconcrete cover.  Tie raceways to reinforcing rods or otherwise secure them to prevent sagging or shifting during \nconcrete placement.  To prevent voids in the concrete, space raceways laterally.  Run conduit larger than 1\" trade \nsize, parallel with or at right angles to the main reinforcement; where at right angles to the reinforcement, the \nconduit shall be close to one of the supports of the slab.  Where nonmetallic conduit or tubing is used, raceways \nmust be converted to rigid metal before rising above floor.  \n \nTape all penetrations through vapor barrier to maintain vapor barrier integrity.  Coordinate requirements with \nvapor barrier installer. \n \nDo not install aluminum conduit embedded in or in contact with concrete. \n \nProtect stub-ups from damage where conduits rise from floor slabs.  Arrange so curved portion of bends are not \nvisible above the finished slab. \n \nPenetrations through slab using rigid metal requires corrosion protection.  Prepare conduit with Scotchrap Pipe \nPrimer and Scotchfill Electrical Insulation Putty or engineering approved equal products.  Provide and apply \nScotchrap Corrosion Protection Tape 51 or engineering approved equal product to length of conduit through slab \nincluding below grade elbow to nearest underground coupling or PVC adapter. Installation of corrosion protection \ntape including layers and overlap shall be per manufacture\u2019s recommendations.   \n \nStub-up Connections:  Extend conduits through concrete floor for connection to freestanding equipment with an \ninternally threaded coupling for plugs.  Extend conductors to equipment with rigid metal conduit; flexible metal \nconduit may be used 6\" above the floor.  Where equipment connections are not made under this contract, install \nscrewdriver-operated threaded flush plugs with floor. \n \nTerminations:  Where raceways are terminated with locknuts and bushings, align the raceway to enter squarely \nand install the locknuts with dished part against the box.  Where terminations cannot be made secure with one (1) \nlocknut, use two (2) locknuts \u2013 one (1) inside and one (1) outside the box. \n \nWhere terminating in threaded hubs, screw the raceway or fitting tight into the hub so the end bears against the \nwire protection shoulder.  Where chase nipples are used, align the raceway so the coupling is square to the box, \nand tighten the chase nipple so no threads are exposed. \n \n \nPull Wires:  Install pull wires in empty raceways.  Use #14 AWG zinc-coated steel or monofilament plastic line \nhaving not less than 200 lb. tensile strength.  Leave not less than 12\" of slack at each end of the pull wire. \n \nTelephone and Signal System Raceways 2\" Trade Size and Smaller:  In addition to the above requirements, install \nraceways 2\" and smaller trade size in maximum lengths at 150\u2019 and with a maximum of two (2), 90\u00b0 bends or \nequivalent.  Install pull or junction boxes where necessary to comply with these requirements. \n \nFlexible Connections:  Install separate ground conductor across flexible connections. Conductor shall be on the \ninside or outside of the raceway. Flexible conduits shall not be used as an equipment ground conductor. \n \nVariable Frequency Drive (VFD) Connections:  Install conductors in metal conduit from the output of the VFD \nto the motor.  Power wiring to the motor must have the maximum separation from all other power wiring whether \nfrom the same drive or other drives. Do not run VFD power wiring in the same conduit with other load or control \nwiring.  Control conductors shall be run in separate metal raceways.  \n \nPVC Externally Coated Rigid Metal Conduit:  Use only fittings approved for use with that material.  Use non-\nmarring tools for the installation to prevent damage to the coating.  Patch all nicks and scrapes in PVC coating \nwith a minimum thickness of 0.040\u201d (1mm) after installing conduit. \n \nSurface Metal Raceway:  Install a separate green ground conductor in raceway from the junction box supplying \nthe raceway to receptacle or fixture ground terminals. \n \nSelect each surface metal raceway outlet box to which a lighting fixture is attached to be of sufficient diameter to \nprovide a seat for the fixture canopy. \n \nWhere a surface metal raceway is used to supply a lighting fixture having central stem suspension with a back \nplate and a canopy, with or without extension ring, the back plate and canopy will serve as the outlet box and no \nseparate outlet box need be provided. \nProvide surface metal raceway outlet box, in addition to the back plate and canopy, at the feed-in location of each \nfluorescent lighting fixture having end stem suspension. \n \nWhere a surface metal raceway extension is made from an existing outlet box on which a lighting fixture is \ninstalled, provide a back plate slightly smaller than the fixture canopy, and no additional surface mounted outlet \nbox need be installed. \n \nExterior (Roof and Above Grade):  Where raceways are installed above a rooftop or are exposed to sunlight, \nraceways shall be installed a minimum of 7/8\u201d above the roof to the bottom of the raceway (except where XHHW-\n2 conductors are utilized.) \n \n3.3. \nADJUSTING AND CLEANING \n \nUpon completion of installation of raceways, inspect interiors of raceways; clear all blockages and remove burrs, \ndirt, and construction debris. \n \n \nEND OF SECTION \n \n", "SECTION 260534": "SECTION 260534 \nELECTRICAL BOXES AND FITTINGS \n \n \nINDEX \nPAGE \n \nPART 1.- GENERAL ............................................................................................................................................. 1 \n1.1.

HDPE \ntubing shall have a minimum working pressure of 300 PSIG and a minimum burst pressure of 1200 PSIG, with \nan operating temperature range of -80\u00b0F to 175\u00b0F or better at rated pressures.   \n \n1/4\" O.D., 0.040\" wall, black   Parker HDPE-43 series or approved equal \n3/8\" O.D., 0.062\" wall, black   Parker HDPE-64 series or approved equal \n \n2.2. \nFITTINGS \n \nProvide correctly sized tubing fittings at all tubing connections.  Stainless steel tubing shall be fitted with stainless \nsteel fittings.  Copper tubing shall be fitted with brass fittings.  Plastic tubing shall be fitted with polyethylene \nfittings of same rating as tubing.  As an alternate, brass or stainless fittings, designed for use with polyethylene \ntubing and equipped with tubing inserts, may be used. \n \nAll fittings shall have NPT screwed threads according to ANSI B1 20.1, unless equipment connections require \notherwise. \n \n2.3. \nTHREAD SEALANT \n \nProvide PTFE Teflon tape, 0.0035\" thickness Mil Spec A-A-58092, tape for fitting thread sealant.  Liquid or paste \ntype thread sealants are prohibited. \n \n \nPART 3. - EXECUTION \n \n3.1. \nCUTTING, BENDING, SHAPING AND CONDITIONING \n \nThe tubing shall be checked for correct diameter and wall thickness. \n \nBend tubing with a correctly sized tubing bender.  Hand bends and wrinkled, flattened or chinked bends will not \nbe accepted.  The installer shall follow Manufacturer's recommendations for minimum bending radius. \n \nCut all tubing with a tubing cutter.  Remove the cutting burr.  \n \nRemove PVC jackets of PVC jacketed tubing at fittings in a manner such that the removal of the jacket does not \ncause damage, or marking of the tubing.  \n \n3.2. \nRACEWAYS \n \nDo not install pneumatic tubing in electrical raceways with wiring. \n \nAll tubing shall be run in such a manner as to give the maximum protection against mechanical damage.  No pipe \nor tube shall be installed with a mechanical stress or strain on it.  Support tubing and tubing bundles in continuous \ntrack, channel, or conduit.  \n \nTubing drops from the main raceway in process areas shall be supported in rigid metal conduit.  Conduit fill limits \nshall not exceed 40 percent.  \n \nEdges, ends, and protrusions in conduit, tubing track, tubing channel, or supports for tubing, shall be free of all \nburrs, sharp edges, and sharp corners to prevent injury to personnel and damage to tubing. \n \nTubing shall be pulled into raceway in such manner as to prevent damage.  Use lubricant to pull tubing into \nraceways. \n \n3.3. \nROUTING \n \nRun conduit, piping, tubing, and similar components in horizontal and vertical alignment with the building \nstructure or in horizontal and vertical alignment with associated principal equipment.  \n \n3.4. \nTUBING INSTALLATION \n \nAll metal and plastic tubing connections shall be made with flareless compression type fittings as specified. \nInstallation shall be made in strict accordance with the fitting Manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. \n \nPrevent foreign material from entering the tubing lines during installation.  Shield all installed, but not connected, \ntubing ends using plugs.  Blow clean all lines with instrument quality air or dry nitrogen prior to connection.  \n \nShort tubing runs shall be installed with at least one 90-degree bend to provide a relief for thermal expansion. \n \nPlastic tubing may be installed in multi-tube bundles. If these bundles are exposed, they shall be armored with \nPVC-coated flex.   \n \nPlastic tubing and unarmored tubing bundles shall be protected inside metal conduit or raceway. Tubing, conduit \nand raceway shall be rigidly fastened to structural supports using tubing clips or fasteners designed for that \npurpose. It shall not be attached to process piping or electrical conduits nor be attached to any surface with cable \nties or perforated strapping. \n \nTransition from a multi-tube bundle to single tube runs shall be made in a junction box using compression type \nbulkhead unions. \n \nPlastic tubing should not be used at all where high or low (cryogenic) temperatures are encountered.   Exposed \nplastic tubing shall not be run near high temperature sources such as uninsulated steam pipe. \n \nInstall all plastic tubing with sufficient slack in each straight run to assure that subsequent shrinkage will not \ncause the tubing to shrink into a state of stress.  It is strongly recommended that plastic tubing not be terminated \nthe same day it is installed into the raceway in order to avoid this.  \n \nFittings shall not be installed near a tubing bend.  A length of straight tube, not deformed by bending, shall be \nrequired.  When a tubing section that contains a bend is being connected, the end section shall be in proper \nalignment with the fitting.  Springing the tube into position with the fitting shall not be permitted, as it may result \nin excessive stress and possible leakage. \n \nInstrument piping and tubing shall be as short as practicable between the source connection and the instrument \nlocation with the minimum number of fittings in order to minimize the potential for leakage. \n \nWrap all tapered pipe threads with Teflon tape to prevent thread galling upon disconnection.  Do not allow the \ntape to extend past the last thread on the connection end.  \n \nAll tubing shall be installed in continuous length from: \n \n1. The instrument to the instrument air supply valve \n2. The instrument to a pneumatic junction box fitting or bulk head fitting \n3. The instrument to another instrument \n \nMake tubing unions in raceways, sheets, or groupings in junction boxes.  \n \nProvide inserts on 3/8\u201d OD and larger plastic tubing.  \n \n3.5. \nTESTING \n \nTest pneumatic tubing system installations in accordance with ISA Standard ISA-7.0.01 \u201cQuality Standard for \nInstrument Air\u201d, Annex C.   \n \nRecords of all tests shall be maintained by the installer and shall be submitted to the Owner. The Owner may \nwitness any tests. \n \nThe instrument at the outlet end of the tubing under test shall remain connected whenever possible.  Allowance \nin the duration of the test shall be made to compensate for the additional volume in the instrument.  \n \nReconnect all instruments to the tubing system after successfully completing the test. Check the re-connections \nwith a bubble test.  Apply a soap solution to the joint under test.  The joint is not properly sealed if bubbles form \naround the joint.  Reseal and recheck until the joint passes. \n \n \n \nEND OF SECTION \n \n", "SECTION 409300": "SECTION 409300 \nINSTRUMENT CALIBRATION AND COMMISSIONING \n \n \nINDEX \nPAGE \n \nPART 1. - GENERAL \n \nExtent of the controls and instrumentation work is indicated on drawings and schedules and by requirements of \nthis section.  This section covers the calibration and commissioning of the electronic and pneumatic \ninstrumentation and controls. \n \nThe Work under this section is subject to requirements of Sections 409010, 409050, 409100 and requirements of \nthe Contract Documents including the general documents, supplementary conditions, and sections under Division \n01 General Requirements. \n \nAny deviations from the equipment components described in this section must be pre-approved by the Owner or \nOwner's Representative prior to purchase. \n \n1.1. \nGENERAL \n \nCalibrate all instruments furnished or installed under Section 409100 which have functions that can be confirmed \nto operate correctly by testing. \n \nAll functions of all instruments shall be tested for full and correct operation.  \n \n \nPART 2. - PRODUCTS \n \n2.1. \nCALIBRATION EQUIPMENT \n \nAll calibration equipment shall be current, up-to-date models, of industrial instrumentation quality, and \nmanufactured by a company regularly engaged in the production of industrial instrumentation calibration \nequipment.  \n \nAll calibration equipment shall have a readout resolution and accuracy that meets or exceeds (one order greater \nwhere possible) that of the instrument to be calibrated.  \n \nAll calibration equipment shall have a current verification of calibration certificate traceable to the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology.  A copy of this document shall be furnished to the Owner before this \nequipment is used for calibration and for all subsequent verification of calibration.  This documentation shall \ninclude an error report of the calibration.  \n \nThe error report of the calibration equipment shall be to an accuracy that meets or exceeds (one order greater \nwhere possible) the accuracy of the calibration equipment.  \n \n \nPART 3. - EXECUTION \n \n3.1. \nGENERAL \n \nInstruments shall be calibrated before the required time of installation.  Instruments that have long lead times for \ndelivery shall be calibrated in time to obtain and calibrate a replacement if necessary before the instrument is \nrequired for installation.  Instruments that have a replacement lead time greater than the time left before \ninstallation shall be calibrated as soon as possible.  The Owner shall be informed immediately of instruments in \nthis category with which problems are encountered.  \n \nAll instruments shall be calibrated to within the manufacturer's stated accuracy.  \n \nAll components of an assembly shall be calibrated individually and then the assembly calibrated.  \n \nOn electronic instruments, simply using the internal simulation of the process output is not considered an \nacceptable calibration method. \n \nAll flow and pressure measuring instruments shall be calibrated to indicate zero flow or pressure at the zero flow \nor pressure input value and to within the manufacturer's stated accuracy at the remaining points. \n \nAll flow instruments designated key or critical will require comparative flowing with the use of a flow cart and \ntraceable transfer flow device.   \n \nThe Contractor shall inform the Owner of all instruments requiring excessive calibration or which cannot be \ncalibrated to within the specified accuracy limits.  The Owner will take appropriate action as required. \n \n3.2. \nCALIBRATION RECORDS \n \nRecord all calibrations, checks, and tests made onto calibration sheets as the calibration is being performed.  The \nfirst calibration of the instrument shall be marked calibration number 1 (one) and subsequent re-calibrations shall \nbe numbered sequentially.  \n \nOne of three (3) types of calibration sheets shall be used:  \n \nAnalog Instrument. \nDiscrete Instrument (On/Off). \nOrifice Inspection. \n \nSome instruments will require more than one calibration sheet.  A modulating valve with a transducer, a \npositioner, and a position switch, for example, will require four (4) sheets; one each of analog calibration sheets \nfor the transducer, the positioner, and the actuator; and one discrete calibration sheet for the position switch.  \nWhen more than one calibration sheet is used, enter the sheet number as part of the total.  The entry for component \ntested shall show which component part is recorded on each sheet.  \n \nAll calibrations shall be recorded on a separate calibration sheet for each instrument or loop.  \nAll entries on calibration sheets shall be handwritten into the correct location for these entries and shall be made \nusing blue water-proof ink by the person performing the calibration.  \n \nDate of calibration shall be recorded on each calibration sheet for each instrument on the date the calibration is \nperformed.  \n \nCalibration sheets shall have all entries completed, except where noted otherwise on the calibration sheet.  The \nentry \"N/A\" can only be used for those entries that are non-applicable.  Any applicable test that was not performed \nshall have a notation entered that clearly indicates the test was not made.  The entry \"N/P\" will not be accepted.  \nNot performing an applicable test must have Owner approval and the reason for not performing the test shall be \nrecorded in the remarks section of the calibration sheet.  \n \nThe actual values of all data shall be entered.  Entries of \"OK\", a check mark, or similar is unacceptable.  \n \nManufacturer name, model, and serial number of the calibration equipment used for the calibration shall be \nrecorded on the calibration sheet for each instrument. \n \nThe calibration date of the calibration equipment and the calibration certificate number for the calibration \nequipment shall be recorded on the calibration sheet for each instrument.  \n \nThe name of the person performing the calibration and the date shall be recorded on the bottom of each calibration \nsheet.  \n \nInstruments that are re-calibrated shall require a new calibration sheet, in which, after completed, shall be \npermanently filed with prior sheets and other associated design, installation, and maintenance records.  Copies of \nthe calibration sheets shall be submitted to the Owner daily for inspection, with the originals collated for \nsubmission to the Owner immediately following project completion.  Calibration sheets and all other associated \nrecords pertaining to a particular instrument and subject to Owner-specified retention periods shall be made \navailable to the Owner for maintenance.   \n \nEach instrument shall have a small, pressure-sensitive adhesive sticker affixed when calibrated.  This shall have \nthe date of calibration and the Calibrator's initials written on it in black, waterproof ink.  This sticker shall be \nplaced upon an internal structure of the instrument where it shall be visible with the cover removed.  It shall not \nbe placed on the cover exterior or interior.  Reasonable judgment shall be used for instruments for which this is \nimpractical, e.g.; liquid filled pressure gauges, and items of like nature. \n \nInterlock relays, hand switches, pilot lights, and like items do not require formal calibration and shall be tested \nduring check- out.  \n \n3.3. \nCALIBRATION EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE \n \nAll calibration equipment shall be maintained under the supervision of qualified personnel to prevent \ncompromising the integrity of the equipment.  \n \nEquipment Abuse: The following actions shall constitute abuse of the calibration equipment: \n1. Equipment storage in a space that does not meet the storage environment specifications of the \nmanufacturer; \n2. Failure to acclimate equipment to an environment meeting the specifications of the manufacturer \nbefore use and used in these conditions; \n3. Failure to ship calibration equipment properly.  Equipment shall be shipped crated, marked \n'Scientific Instrument', and shipped with special handling service via a commercial courier, e.g.; \nPurolator, Federal Express, United Parcel Service. \n4. Transporting un-crated calibration equipment in the trunk of an automobile or in the bed of a truck. \n \nAny calibration equipment which has been tampered with, over-ranged, or abused shall have all damage repaired \nand shall have its calibration re-certified before being used again. \n \n3.4. \nGENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURES FOR ANALOG INSTRUMENTS \n \nAll analog instruments (to include modulating valves) shall be given a three-point calibration check of the \n \ninstrument after calibration (as left).  This shall be accomplished by applying an input signal equivalent to 0, 50 \nand 100 percent of the input range of the instrument.  This check shall be made with both an increasing signal \nfrom below zero percent to one hundred percent and a decreasing signal from above one hundred percent to zero \npercent with no overshoot or back up. The percentage test points may be changed in cases where it is more \nreasonable to do so; i.e.; it may be more practical to test a square root extraction module at other points to obtain \na more meaningful test.  \n \nThe calibration may be made at less than three points for instruments that are not normally checked at this many \npoints.  This includes pressure gauges and thermometers.  Other instruments, such as pH meters, conductivity \nmeters, vapor fractionating analyzers, infra-red absorption analyzers, and the like are normally calibrated using a \nset of known samples. \n  \nAll analog instruments with digital communication shall be read and recorded at the first (nearest to the sending \ndevice) accessible point of raw data.  The data register should not be scaled or in engineering units but merely an \nA/D conversion of the proportional magnitude respective to the device\u2019s range and bit resolution.  Scaling and \nengineering units of same are checked (verified or validated) elsewhere.  \n \n3.5. \nGENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURES FOR DISCRETE INSTRUMENTS \n \nAll discrete instruments, pressure switches, temperature switches, on/off valves, position switches, flow switches, \nand like items, shall be tested at the operation point for proper functioning and adjusted as required.  Adjustments \nmade shall be recorded on the calibration sheet.  The actual operating point shall be recorded on the calibration \nsheet.  \n \nThis check shall be made with an increasing signal from below the trip point until the point of actuation for high \ncondition switches and with a decreasing signal from above the trip point until the point of actuation for low \ncondition switches.  \n \n3.6. \nSPECIFIC CALIBRATION REQUIREMENTS \n \nMass Flow Instruments: These shall be calibrated by the manufacturer.  An appropriate calibration certificate with \nfull details of the calibration including as-found and as-left conditions these shall be obtained from the \nmanufacturer for each element/transmitter.  Requirements of manufacturer\u2019s calibration shall be no less stringent \nthan this specification. \n \nTOC/Conductivity analyzers: These shall be calibrated by the manufacturer.  An appropriate calibration \ncertificate with full details of the calibration including as-found and as-left conditions shall be obtained from the \nmanufacturer for each element/transmitter.  Requirements of manufacturer\u2019s calibration shall be no less stringent \nthan this specification. \n \nLevel Instruments: Level probe type instruments using capacitance, conductivity, or RF shall be calibrated in \naccordance with the manufacturer's procedure.  Float or displacer type instruments shall be calibrated by one of \nthe following methods: 1) By using calibration weights to shop calibrate and confirm in service, 2) By using a \nwell to hold liquid of a known height and of a specific gravity which matches the process.  \n \nPressure and Differential Pressure Instruments: Calibrate using a pressure source.  Pressure instruments with \nremote seals shall be calibrated using a flange jig fitted to the diaphragm face.  The calibration of instruments \nwith remote seals shall correctly simulate the different field elevations of the installed transmitter and seal.  The \ncalibration of pressure instruments connected with filled impulse lines shall correctly simulate the effect of the \nfill fluid.  \n \nResistance Temperature Detectors (RTD) These shall be checked with an ohmmeter for continuity, and, for \nungrounded RTDs, shorts to the sheath.  RTDs shall be checked using a temperature bath, or baths, capable of \ntemperature variations as required by the span of the instrument.    \n \nAnalog Temperature Transmitters having RTD inputs shall be calibrated first using a decade box, and then finally \nusing the actual temperature element that will be used with the transmitter in the aforementioned temperature \nbath(s).  \n \nDiscrete Temperature Instruments shall be checked using a temperature bath, or baths, capable of temperature \nvariations as required by the span of the instrument.  \n \nValves: All valves shall be leak-tested in the closed position and shall meet the specified leak rating.  It is \nrecommended this check be made initially.  Valves, modulating and on/off, shall be fully closed with an input \nsignal corresponding to fully closed.  Valves, modulating and on/off, which are fail closed shall be fully closed \nwith the design conditions for full closed in effect.  \n \nModulating Valves: These valves shall be calibrated to obtain a fully closed valve prior to the signal reaching the \nclosed valve value of the signal to ensure the valve closes with the control signal.  This shall be between one (1) \npercent and two (2) percent for air-to-open and between 98 percent and 99 percent for air-to-close.  Check the \nactuator and trim for the amount of hysteresis.  Actuators with properly adjusted stem packing are expected to \nhave less than 0.2-PSI hysteresis.  Inform the Owner of valves with sticky actuators.  Actuator and trim shall be \nchecked for full travel as specified by the manufacturer.  Set the travel indicator to indicate closed at the fully \nclosed position.  Set the actuator to the manufacturer's stated bench setting as a separate calibration from the \npositioner calibration.  Calibrate the positioner to obtain full travel proportional to the positioner input signal.  \nCalibrate the transducer.  Calibrate the assembly to obtain a fully closed valve at the required signal for fully \nclosed.  \n \nOn/off valves: Check the valve for correctly installed pneumatic connections and solenoid valves.  Check the \nvalve for proper direction of operation and fail position.  Check the valve for full travel.  Check that the valve \ncloses fully.  Set the speed controls to Owner's requirements.  \n \nValve Position Switches: These switches, on modulating and on/off valves, shall be checked using a slowly \nchanging input signal to approach and reach the point of switch actuation.  On/off valves will require a restriction \nin the air line to do this.  This will allow checking that an on/off valve position switch does not indicate closed \nshould the valve stick open a small amount.  Valves, with the exception of manual valves with position switches, \nshall not be manually operated to accomplish this calibration.  Valves shall have all other components of the \nassembly calibrated before the position switches are calibrated.  \n \nThe Analog signal being brought to the modulating valve shall be the signal used to position the valve for \ncalibration of the position switches.  The value of this signal shall be the value entered onto the Calibration Sheet \nfor the switch.  The pneumatic signal to the valve shall be used for those valves having remote transducers, i.e.; \nthe transducer is not mounted directly onto the valve assembly.  \n \nThe position of on/off valves upon switch actuation shall be the entry entered for these and shall be the Calibrator's \nvisual interpretation of the position of the trim.  Fully-closed, fully-opened, and not-closed position switches on \nvalves shall be calibrated to actuate as close to the valve mechanical stop as is practical.  \n \nSmall gauges on valve positioners and air-set regulators require no testing.  These shall be replaced if considered \ndefective.  \n \npH Analytical Systems: Remove the probe and insert into buffer solutions having pH levels of the process at the \nprocess extremes and the process midpoint.  \n \nOther Ion Specific Analytical Systems: Remove the probe and insert into a container of fluid having similar \ncharacteristics as the process fluid.  Check for proper analyzer operation.  Remove the probe and recheck zero.  \n \nElectrical Power Measuring Instruments: Watt transmitters shall be shop calibrated and confirmed in operation.  \nShop calibrate current transmitters to the anticipated current flow from the current transformer.  Confirm this \n \nOrifice Plates: Concentric, square-edged, beveled-relief; record the results of this check on the orifice inspection \nsheet.  These shall be checked for conformity to the specifications for pipe size, ANSI rating, material, bore size, \nbore configuration, specified vent/drain, and correct upstream side tang stamping of plates with tangs.  The orifice \nplate shall be inspected for bowing and warping.  The orifice plate shall be flat to within 0.02 (two hundredths) \ninch per inch of the inside diameter of pipe size and schedule into which the orifice plate will be installed.  The \ndam bore shall be inspected for correct configuration: The straight bore of the dam shall not be more than 1/50 \n(one fiftieth) of the dam height.  The bevel shall not be less than 45 degrees measured from the piping centerline.  \nThe orifice plate shall be inspected for nicks and scratches.  There shall be none on the upstream or on the \ndownstream face.  The upstream edge of the dam shall be inspected for burrs and sharpness.  There shall be no \nburrs or ridging on this edge and there shall be no reflected light from this edge when viewed from any angle with \nnormal vision in a shaded north light.  Orifice plates, integral orifices, flow nozzles, and head-producers other \nthan concentric, square-edged, beveled-relief orifice plates shall be inspected for conformity with the \nspecifications and the manufacturer's information.  Record the results of this check on the orifice inspection sheet.  \n \nItems Which the Owner May Approve for Minimal Calibration and Records: Thermometers and pressure gauges \nshall be checked at a point near the operating point, unless the Owner has agreed to accept the vendor's calibration \ncheck.  These shall have a pressure adhesive sticker applied showing the date of test and the Calibrator's initials.  \nWith Owner approval, the vendor's sticker, if present, shall suffice on these items.  \n \nSight glasses, level gauges, and like items need no testing or checking other than the receiving check that these \nitems are actually as specified.  No sticker is required, unless the instrumentation Contractor wishes to do such \nfor his own record purposes.  \n \nSmall gauges on valve positioners and air-set regulators require no testing.  These shall be replaced if considered \ndefective.  \n \n \n \nEND OF SECTION \n", "SECTION 409350": "SECTION 409350 \nCONTROL PANELS \n \n \nINDEX \nPAGE \n \nPART 1. - GENERAL ............................................................................................................................................ 2 \n1.1.

The Manufacturer shall assist Factory \n \nAcceptance Testing (FAT) as it is defined and indicated below.  FAT is in addition to the ASME pressure tests \n \n \n \nand other tests as required by code. The Manufacturer shall submit the schedule for FAT to the Owner and \n \nEngineer.  FAT shall be conducted at the Manufacturer's facility with the Owner or Owner's representative \n \npresent, who shall be notified at least two weeks prior to the anticipated test date.   \n \n \n \nThe Manufacturer shall perform Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) as it is defined and specified in Section \n \n110010 Equipment General Requirements.  See attached specifications for additional FAT requirements.  The \n \nfollowing items shall be the required tests to be performed at the FAT. \n \n \n \nGeneral Verifications: \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nVerify the filter housing adherence to specifications, datasheets and project documentation. \n \n\u2022 \nVerify compliance with approval drawings, including P&IDs. \n \n\u2022 \nVerify the system dimensions \u2013 footprint, height, and nozzle arrangement. \n \n\u2022 \nReview of turnover package for accuracy and completeness. \n \n\u2022 \nVerify the calibration reports for instruments used during FAT. \n \n \n \nSpray Device Coverage:  If spray devices are required in the data sheets, then a spray device coverage test shall \n \nbe performed. The Manufacturer shall provide a surge vessel, hoses and circulating pump capable of the required \n \nflow rate and pressure (not to exceed housing pressure) for the proper operation of the spray device(s) of each \n \nhousing to be tested.  All wetted components of the test equipment shall be either stainless steel or plastic, and \n \nshall leave no residue other than the test indicator solution on the housing(s) to be tested.  This test shall be for \n \nthe purpose of evaluating the spray device(s) for coverage and shadowing.  The test indicator solution shall be an \n \naqueous riboflavin solution at a nominal concentration of 100 ppm of Eastman Kodak #EK117712 Reagent Grade \n \nRiboflavin Orange powder (1 gram of powder per 10 liters of water) or approved equivalent. \n \n \n \nAll internal, wetted accessories that are indicated on each housing data sheet shall be installed on that housing as \n \npart of the spray coverage testing of that housing.  The test indicator solution shall be applied to all the interior \n \nsurfaces of the housing (including the inside of all nozzles and their associated caps) by some method other than \n \nusing the actual spray devices and the test equipment (e.g., a spray bottle and/or by filling the housing completely \n \nwith the test indicator solution, then draining it completely).   \n \n \n \nThe test indicator solution shall be allowed to completely drain from the housing, and the interior of the housing, \n \nincluding internal accessories, shall be inspected for complete coverage with the test indicator solution prior to \n \nbeginning the spray coverage testing.  The inspection shall be conducted with a UV \"black\" light, and more test \n \nindicator solution shall be re-applied to any areas that are not covered. Test water flow shall be initiated at the \n \nflow rate and pressure required for the correct operation of the spray device(s), and shall flow for 30 seconds with \n \nthe bottom outlet of the housing wide open to drain (no re-circulation back to the surge housing).   \n \n \n \nThe initiation of flow shall mark the beginning of the spray coverage test.  After the test has ended, allow the \n \nhousing to drain. The interior of the housing, including accessories, shall be completely inspected with a UV light \n \nto determine if any residual test indicator solution remains after the test.  If any residual test indicator solution is \n \ndetected, another 30 second rinse burst shall be applied, and the interior of the housing re-inspected.  If any \n \nresidual test indicator solution is detected, the spray device(s) shall be adjusted and/or modified (e.g., more or \n \nlarger holes in spray balls, re-positioning of spray device(s), increased flow rate and/or pressure), and the entire \n \ntest repeated, including a fresh application of test indicator solution.   \n \n \n \nOnce a satisfactory test has been completed (no residual test indicator solution detected), it shall be repeated to \n \nverify the successful results.  The test will be considered successful only when two successful test runs have been \n \ncompleted in series.  The Manufacturer shall document each and every test, and shall include the time and date \n \nof each test, rinse (spray) time, modifications made (if any), and the areas that failed the visual inspection (if any) \n \nin every test. \n \n \n \n \n \nDrainability Testing:  Water shall be introduced and allowed to pool in the housing base with the bottom port \n \ncapped.  The bottom port cap shall then be removed and the liquid allowed to drain into a catch container.  No \n \nliquid shall remain pooled at any location in the housing base. \n \n \n \nSurface Finish Testing:  The Manufacturer shall make available an averaging profilometer along with a sample \n \nthat can be agreed to be \u201cacceptable\u201d (retain duplicate of original sample submitted; i.e., original sample to be \n \nprovided to Owner for record keeping purposes) for establishing accuracy.  Each housing shall be visually \n \ninspected in its entirety with areas of concern noted with tape flags or Post-it notes.  These points shall then be \n \ninspected using the following procedure: \n \n \n \n\u2022 \nThe area to be inspected shall be cleaned using acetone and a clean, lint free rag. \n \n\u2022 \nThe surface area being checked shall be recorded. \n \n\u2022 \nReadings shall be taken in three directions, two of which shall be 90\u00b0 apart. \n \n\u2022 \nAll readings shall be recorded. \n \n \n \nA minimum of four and a maximum of six points shall be checked on the interior of each housing with the top \n \nand bottom head each being checked.  The exterior of the housing shall also be inspected in this manner with a \n \nmaximum of five points measured.  Failure of two or more points may require additional testing.  The \n \nManufacturer shall provide access to all surfaces.  The housing(s) will be evaluated to determine compliance with \n \nthe specifications.  The Manufacturer shall rework any areas not meeting the specification.   \n \n \n \n3.1.1.

Where differences apply, they will be noted. \n \nThe CIP skid shall be provided with the following components as a minimum: \n\u2022 \nOne (1) Rinse/surge tank \n\u2022 \nTwo (2) Wash/circulation tanks \n\u2022 \nCIP supply pump, variable frequency drive (VFD) compatible (VFD provided by others) \n\u2022 \nCIP supply heat exchanger \n\u2022 \nCIP return strainer \n\u2022 \nAir blow filter \n\u2022 \nPiping (w/single point connections for utilities where applicable) \n\u2022 \nAutomated and manual valves \n\u2022 \nInstrumentation \n\u2022 \nSkid framing and support for all components. \n\u2022 \nLocal Disconnect \n \nThe CIP skid shall be capable of cleaning process equipment with integral air gaps (e.g., tanks), as well as closed \npipe circuits.  Each unit shall be capable of operating in either a circulation (washes and circulated rinses) or once-\nthrough mode (pre- and final rinses). \n \n \n2.1.1. \nRinse and Wash Solutions \n \nAmbient WFI will be delivered directly from a WFI loop point-of-use valve (by others) to the rinse/surge tank on \nthe skid, via a static spray ball.  At no time will water be returned to the rinse/surge tank, except during rinse/surge \ntank cleaning procedures (i.e., rinses will be to drain, via the CIP return piping on each skid, or circulated back to \nthe wash/circulation tank). \n \nRO water will be delivered directly from a RO loop point-of-use valve (by others) to the wash/circulation tanks.  \nWash solutions shall be created in the wash/circulation tanks using a circulation loop that will return water directly \nto this tank via a j-tube in a separated top mounted nozzle with no spray ball.  Once created, wash solutions shall \nbe delivered to the connected distribution system via the CIP supply pump and returned to the wash/circulation \ntank via a j-tube.  Circulated rinses shall be handled in the same manner, if pre-heating is required. \n \nCleaning chemicals (detergents, caustics and acids) for the make-up of wash solutions will be supplied \nautomatically to each system from the facility chemical distribution system operating at a constant pressure. Each \nCIP skid shall be capable of dosing the required volume of chemical solutions into the system in order to reach \nthe desired conductivity.  The amount of chemical added for the wash solution should be based on a total volume \nset-point as determined during startup and commissioning.  The chemicals shall be supplied to the \nwash/circulation tank.  Water and chemicals shall be circulated on the skid via the wash/circulation tank until the \ndesired (based on pre-programmed recipes) conductivity and/or time set point is reached, after which the solution \nshall be ready for delivery to the distribution system. \n \nA divert valve assembly shall be located downstream of all components on each CIP skid supply line and shall \ndivert flow either directly to drain, to the distribution system or to the wash/circulation tank.  The CIP return line \non each skid shall be configured with a divert valve assembly that will divert flow either directly to drain or into \nthe wash/circulation tank via a top mounted nozzle with no spray device. \n \n2.1.2. \nFlow Control \n \nEach CIP skid will be required to provide different flow rates to the connected distribution system depending on \nthe particular circuit piping or equipment to be cleaned.   \n \nFlow control shall be accomplished using both a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) (by others) on the CIP supply \npump and a Coriolis flow meter on pump discharge line for analog flow control.  The control system shall set the \nCIP supply pump to a pre-set speed for each cycle, via the VFD, based on the maximum flow rate plus 15% that \nwill be required for that cycle.   \n \nThe flow meter shall be used to provide feedback to adjust the VFD and shall vary depending on a particular \nphase of the cycle (e.g., solution make-up and corresponding direct circulation to the wash/circulation tank, supply \nto the distribution system, and diversion to drain).   \n \n2.1.3. \nTemperature Control \n \nEach CIP skid shall be capable of maintaining required solution and rinse temperatures listed on the data sheet \nfor all required flow rates using a heat exchanger.  Reference the attached heat exchanger data sheet for each CIP \nskid for more information regarding each unit.  The steam supply line on each skid shall be trapped and provided \nwith a drip leg. \n \n2.1.4. \nLevel Control \n \nThe level in the rinse and wash tanks need to be controlled. All tanks will need to control level by opening or \nclosing the water point of use valve on the water loop.  Level will be monitored in the tanks to make sure an \nadequate level is maintained. \n   \n \n2.1.5. \nDrainability \n \nEach CIP skid shall be completely drainable, requiring at a minimum an automated casing drain (true low-point \nof skid) and automatic drain valve on the supply pump suction line.  At the end of each circulation cycle, the \nvalves are opened until the tank is empty (level = 0), plus additional time afforded for piping. \n \n2.1.6. \nAir Blows \n \nEach CIP skid shall be capable of providing air blows using clean compressed air as indicated in the Available \nUtilities, at the pressure indicated.  The air shall be supplied to the system via an automated diaphragm valve.  \nUpstream components on the air line shall include, at a minimum, a check valve and a 0.2 micron filter. \n \n2.1.7. \nReturn of CIP Solution to CIP Skid \n \nIf it is determined that additional motive force is required to move the CIP solution from its intended destination \nback to the CIP skid, a separate CIP return pump will be installed near the equipment and general cleaning area.  \nCIP return pumps will be provided by others. \n \n2.2. \nBASIC FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION  \n \nEach CIP skid shall be fully automated.  The CIP skid will be controlled by the site DeltaV control system.  The \ncontrol system shall also be capable of controlling valves on the supply and return distribution systems to which \neach skid will be connected.  Refer to the Instrumentation and Controls section in this specification and the \nDivision 40 Specifications for more information on the control system. \n \nA typical CIP cycle will be as follows: \n1. Once through rinse to CIP waste system of piping/equipment circuit from 2nd wash tank using RO \n2. Fill wash/circulation tank from RO supply drop \n3. Charge caustic cleaning chemical into CIP system while heating solution \n4. Circulate caustic CIP wash solution through piping/equipment circuit and back to tank while \nsimultaneously filling 2nd wash tank \n5. Discharge cleaning solution to CIP waste system \n6. Once through rinse to CIP waste system of piping/equipment circuit from 2nd wash tank using RO \n7. Air blow of piping/equipment circuit to drain followed by system vent \n8.

These flow conditions must occur at operational points on the pump curve \nin order to allow adequate control (i.e., not on a flat portion of the curve or near the operational extremes of dead \nheading or full run out).     \n \nPumps (and their corresponding gear boxes and motors) shall be secured to the skid framing with stainless steel \nhardware.  Delrin plastic, or approved equivalent, shall be used between the bases of pumps, motors and gear \nboxes and the frames in order to provide vibration dampening and mechanical protection.     \n \n2.4.1. \nCentrifugal Pumps \n \nCentrifugal pumps shall be sized and specified to operate as close as possible to their \u201cmaximum efficiency point\u201d \nwhile meeting the operating conditions indicated on the data sheets.  The impellers for centrifugal pumps shall be \nsized and selected to meet these requirements, but the pump models shall be selected so that the impeller that \nmeets these requirements is neither the largest nor smallest available for the particular pump model for which it \nis installed.  Pump impellers shall be statically and dynamically balanced. \n \n2.4.2. \nPump Motors   \n \nProvide motors that are non-overloading within the full range of the pump performance curve. \n \n2.5. \nHEAT EXCHANGERS \n \nHeat exchangers shall comply with the requirements indicated on the attached data sheets (specification 230755).  \nThey shall be oriented and installed on the skid so that they can be serviced without the requirement to completely \nremove them from the skid or to remove other components from the skid.  This shall include adequate pull space \nfor shell and / or tube bundle for shell-and-tube exchangers.  All ASME-rated heat exchangers shall be provided \nwith the appropriate pressure safety relief devices, which shall be constructed of stainless steel.  For heat \nexchangers specified as requiring insulation, the insulation shall be factory installed by the heat exchanger \nmanufacturer. \n \nSteam and condensate piping for each heat exchanger shall be configured to prevent stall conditions at low load.  \nNo vacuum breakers shall be installed on the shell (steam) side of the unit, but each unit shall be provided with \nan automatic air vent. \n \n2.5.1. \nSanitary Shell and Tube Heat Exchangers \n \nSanitary shell and tube heat exchangers shall be used on critical systems with CIP solution flow through the tubes \nand utility flow through the shell.  The heat exchanger shall be installed with a 5\u00b0 tilt for drainability when installed \nhorizontally.  Assuming the heat exchanger is a U-tube design, the tilt shall have the tubeside head or bonnet at \nthe low end.  Final orientation and installation shall assure complete drainability on the sanitary (tube) side with \nno crevices or dead legs.  Bypass drain channels shall be provided on the tube side heads where necessary to \nfacilitate drainability.  Whenever possible, each heat exchanger and connected process piping shall be configured \nand oriented so that the flow of CIP fluid is upward through the unit in order to displace air from the tube side.  \nThe heat exchanger should be a double tube sheet design to prevent contamination of the CIP stream with the \nutility flow.  The shell side should be baffled as necessary to ensure turbulent flow and increased heat transfer \ncoefficient.   \n \n \n \n \n \n2.6. \nPROCESS AND VENT FILTERS \n \nSanitary cartridge style filter housings for gas filtration and tank vent filtration shall comply with the requirements \nindicated on the attached data sheets (specification 433113).  Provide the housing with the appropriate fittings \nand valves to allow for complete drainability during process and cleaning operations.  Each filter housing shall \nbe oriented and installed so that the housing dome can be easily removed, with a filter installed in the housing, \nwith no other disassembly required on the skid.    \n \n2.6.1. \nAir Filter \n \nThis filter housing is for air (or inert gas) used for pressure testing and / or air blow phases.  It will be installed in \nsuch a manner that air flow is from the outside of the element in.   \n \n2.6.2. \nVent Filter \n \nThe final rinse tank should have a hydrophobic sterilizing grade vent filter on the tank headspace.  This filter \nshould be sized appropriately to vent air from the vessel during filling and pull air during tank draining.      \n \n2.7. \nNON-SANITARY STEAM TRAPS \n \nProvide a pressure powered pumping trap for the heat exchanger according to the P&ID. \n \n2.7.1. \nPressure Powered Pumping Trap \n \nProvide a Spirax Sarco, or approved equivalent, pressure powered pumping trap which will use the supply steam \nas the motive force.
