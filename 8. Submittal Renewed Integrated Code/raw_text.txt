PREPARATION OF INITIAL BOUNDARIES 
A. 
Objective:  Once the clean area "boundaries" and "interior walls" have been established, the following three 
(3) objectives are required: 
1. 
To clean the area to the minimum acceptability. 
2. 
To establish a cleaning protocol that will assure maintenance of a clean environment within the 
"outer boundaries" at all times during the remaining construction. 
3. 
To place the area under positive pressure to minimize outside particulate migration. 
B. 
The Contractor shall furnish temporary blowers and industrial grade HEPA filters to accomplish 
pressurization. 
3.3 
OUTLINE OF BUILDING CLEAN-DOWN 
A. 
Contractor Responsibility:  The Contractors involved at the beginning of Phase III of construction shall 
perform the following: 
1. 
"Clean area" interior flat surfaces shall be made broom clean and all construction debris shall be 
cleaned within the "outer boundaries". 
2. 
All vertical and overhead surfaces shall also be brushed to dislodge construction debris. 
 
3. 
Contractor shall commence with two (2) separate wash-downs to remove all visible traces of 
construction dust and debris. 
4. 
All flat surfaces will be wet-mopped after wash-down to assure the removal of all dust and debris-
laden water. 
B. 
Field Inspection:  The Owner's Representative shall inspect the construction area for compliance.  The 
criteria used for compliance will be as follows: 
1. 
No visible dust or debris may be present.  An objective test shall be the rub down of surfaces with 
a black felt rag.  Some rub off of dust will be expected from this test even after the most diligent 
cleaning.  A gray residual on the black felt will be deemed unacceptable.  Any interior surface is 
eligible for this test. 
2. 
The Contractor shall commence with recleaning until this rate of cleanliness is achieved. 
3.4 
MAINTAINING BUILDING CLEAN-DOWN 
A. 
Contractor Responsibility 
1. 
Work Force Controls:  Major migration of particulate will occur into the building if the work force 
is allowed to walk directly from outside into the building.  Contractor shall, therefore, implement 
the following controls to prevent this from occurring. 
a. 
A temporary laydown area shall be established immediately adjacent to a singular "worker 
entrance area".  All workers shall be provided with facilities for cleaning work boots if 
working in areas that do not require shoe covers.  Water, brushers, and rags shall be provided 
for this purpose.  An alternate would be to issue clean work shoes (safety) to the entering 
work force. 
b. 
A 10-foot strip of tack mats will be provided and maintained at the entrance to the clean area 
envelope. 
c. 
The Owner's Representative will determine if the standard of cleanliness of the work force 
entrance area is being maintained by making spot inspections. 
2. 
Equipment and Material Staging Area:  The Contractor shall provide an area where all tools, 
materials, and equipment brought into the clean space "envelope" shall be inspected and cleaned 
immediately adjacent to clean area.  Minimum standard of cleanliness shall be no visible dirt or 
dust.  With a black felt rub down, only slight amounts of dust will be tolerated.  Contractor shall be 
responsible for policing this area to maintain its cleanliness. 
3. 
Trade Cleanup Protocols:  Each trade will be required to provide substantially greater post work 
cleaning than normal.  Broom clean is not acceptable.  At the completion of each job task, the 
Contractor shall be required to vacuum, wet mop, and wipe down the area until its previous level of 
cleanliness is achieved.  Compliance shall be assured by spot checks from the Owner's 
Representative. 
a. 
Vacuum cleaners shall be equipped with post-filtering devices having a 0.3-micron rating. 
3.5 
STAGING OF CONSTRUCTION ELEMENTS 
A. 
Special Requirements and Mechanical Components:  All ducts, coils, filters, air handlers, fans, and other 
elements in contact with the airstream shall be precleaned in the staging area to a set level of cleanliness.

surfaces.  This will include any outlet boxes or floor/wall ceiling recesses. 
b. 
Wipe down shall be by clean potable water, mild non-phosphate detergent at a 1000:1 mix 
using clean lint-free rags approved by the Owner's Representative. 
c. 
A second wash down shall commence using clean potable water in the same manner. 
d. 
Floors shall be scrubbed and polished using a floor-polishing machine. 
e. 
The remaining floor area adjacent to the clean space shall also require comprehensive 
cleaning.  Wash partitions and floors to maintain a dust-free condition. 
3. 
Access into the building must also be restricted to discourage infiltration of outside particulate.  The 
Contractor shall continue maintenance of the Contractor's entrance and boot cleaning area.  Shoe 
covers shall be worn in the cleanroom. 
4. 
Install 3-foot by 6-foot sticky mats outside the entrance to the gowning areas as well as the entrance 
into the cleanroom.  Also, within the clean space prior to the first course cleaning. 
5. 
All personnel entering into the cleanroom after the second course cleaning is completed shall wear 
booties and lab coats.  At this point, cleanroom garb shall be Contractor-supplied as approved by 
the Owner's Representative. 
6. 
Air handlers and associated ducts, and plenums shall be checked for cleanliness.  They must have 
all air contacting surfaces capable of passing a black felt test, clean as necessary. 
7. 
Activate air handlers and pressurize rooms to maintain 0.03 "WC minimum pressure differential 
between clean and less clean areas.  The balance Contractor shall commence and complete his initial 
rough balance of the clean area systems. 
C. 
Commence with the first of two (2) final wipe downs.  Use non-shedding cleanroom wipes (saturated with 
isopropyl alcohol) or tacky wipes.  All exposed surfaces to be wiped.

INDEX 
PAGE 
 
 
PART 1. - GENERAL  
 
1.1. 
DEFINITIONS 
 
Enhanced Turnover Package (ETOP) is a pre-validation document provided by the Contractor which is used as a 
foundation for the Installation Qualification and Operational Qualification phases of Validation.   
 
Validation:  Establishing documented evidence which provides a high degree of assurance that a specific process 
will consistently produce a product meeting its predetermined specifications and quality characteristics. 
 
Installation Qualification:  Documented verification that all key aspects of the installation adhere to 
manufacturer's recommendation, appropriate codes, and approved design intentions.   
 
Operational Qualification:  Documented verification that equipment can operate as intended and is capable of 
satisfactory operation over the entire range of pressures, temperatures, times, and other operational parameters. 
 
Performance Qualification:   Documented evidence that the system or subsystem performs as intended throughout 
all anticipated operating ranges.   
 
1.2. 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
Construction Manager shall be responsible for providing an ETOP Package to the Owner. 
 
Owner shall be responsible for providing standard forms for execution by the Contractor.  Owner shall be 
responsible for Validation of the project.  Validation includes Installation Qualification, Operational 
Qualification, and Performance Qualification. 
 
1.3. 
ENHANCED TURNOVER PACKAGE 
 
Documentation Requirements for the ETOP are listed in the attached ETOP Master Matrix.  The documentation 
is divided into eight sections.  ETOP information is required for both systems and specific equipment.  The grid 
system denotes areas of responsibility for each portion of the package.  The party which is designated as 
responsible shall collect the appropriate data from vendors, suppliers, contractors, execute the appropriate 
operations (inspection, reports, etc.) and compile all of the data in an approved Owner format.  
 
The ETOP Matrix provides a checklist format for the collection and execution of required deliverables for each 
system and equipment.  Detailed information on checklist items can be located in specific specification sections 
(Operation & Maintenance Manuals, Testing and Balancing, Record Drawings, etc.).  Where a specification 
requirement differs from the ETOP Matrix, provide the more stringent execution or documentation requirement.  
Refer to the Owner’s Representative for required clarifications.  
 
 
 
Items supplied are sourced from various members of the team.  Responsibility is documented in the ETOP matrix 
with the following codes: 
o 
(V) Vendor 
o 
(CM) Construction Manager 
o 
(C) Contractor 
o 
(E) Engineering 
o 
(I) Integrator 
o 
(O) Owner 
o 
(VA) Validation 
o 
(NA) Not Applicable 
 
Each system or equipment item shall be provided with its own complete turnover package consisting of the items 
checked off as required.  Each package shall be suitable as a stand-alone package.  In addition to the specific 
responsibilities indicated by the matrix, the Construction Manager shall be responsible for compilation of all of 
the designated documents into a 3-ring bound document for each package. 
 
Before construction begins, the Construction Manager shall develop and submit, for approval by the Owner, a 
plan for organization and execution of the ETOP package.

with joint-sealant manufacturer's written instructions and the following requirements: 
1. 
Remove all foreign material from joint substrates that could interfere with adhesion of joint 
sealant, including dust, paints (except for permanent, protective coatings tested and approved 
for sealant adhesion and compatibility by sealant manufacturer), old joint sealants, oil, grease, 
waterproofing, water repellents, water, surface dirt, and frost. 
2. 
Clean porous joint substrate surfaces by brushing, grinding, mechanical abrading, or a 
combination of these methods to produce a clean, sound substrate capable of developing 
optimum bond with joint sealants. Remove loose particles remaining after cleaning operations 
above by vacuuming or blowing out joints with oil-free compressed air. Porous joint 
substrates include the following: 
a. 
Concrete. 
b.

b. 
Glass. 
c. 
Porcelain enamel. 
d. 
Glazed surfaces of ceramic tile. 
B. 
Joint Priming: Prime joint substrates where recommended by joint-sealant manufacturer or as 
indicated by preconstruction joint-sealant-substrate tests or prior experience. Apply primer to comply 
with joint-sealant manufacturer's written instructions. Confine primers to areas of joint-sealant bond; 
do not allow spillage or migration onto adjoining surfaces. 
C. 
Masking Tape: Use masking tape where required to prevent contact of sealant or primer with 
adjoining surfaces that otherwise would be permanently stained or damaged by such contact or by 
 
cleaning methods required to remove sealant smears. Remove tape immediately after tooling without 
disturbing joint seal. 
3.3 
INSTALLATION OF JOINT SEALANTS 
A. 
General: Comply with joint-sealant manufacturer's written installation instructions for products and 
applications indicated, unless more stringent requirements apply. 
B. 
Sealant Installation Standard: Comply with recommendations in ASTM C 1193 for use of joint 
sealants as applicable to materials, applications, and conditions indicated. 
C. 
Install sealant backings of kind indicated to support sealants during application and at position 
required to produce cross-sectional shapes and depths of installed sealants relative to joint widths that 
allow optimum sealant movement capability. 
1. 
Do not leave gaps between ends of sealant backings. 
2. 
Do not stretch, twist, puncture, or tear sealant backings. 
3. 
Remove absorbent sealant backings that have become wet before sealant application and 
replace them with dry materials. 
D. 
Install bond-breaker tape behind sealants where sealant backings are not used between sealants and 
backs of joints. 
E. 
Install sealants using proven techniques that comply with the following and at the same time 
backings are installed: 
1. 
Place sealants so they directly contact and fully wet joint substrates. 
2. 
Completely fill recesses in each joint configuration. 
3. 
Produce uniform, cross-sectional shapes and depths relative to joint widths that allow 
optimum sealant movement capability. 
F. 
Tooling of Nonsag Sealants: Immediately after sealant application and before skinning or curing 
begins, tool sealants according to requirements specified in subparagraphs below to form smooth, 
uniform beads of configuration indicated; to eliminate air pockets; and to ensure contact and 
adhesion of sealant with sides of joint. 
1. 
Remove excess sealant from surfaces adjacent to joints. 
2. 
Use tooling agents that are approved in writing by sealant manufacturer and that do not 
discolor sealants or adjacent surfaces. 
3. 
Provide concave joint profile per Figure 8A in ASTM C 1193 unless otherwise indicated. 
4. 
Provide flush joint profile at locations indicated on Drawings according to Figure 8B in 
ASTM C 1193. 
3.4 
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL 
A. 
Field-Adhesion Testing: Field test joint-sealant adhesion to joint substrates as follows: 
1. 
Extent of Testing: Test completed, and cured sealant joints as follows: 
a. 
Perform 10 tests for the first 1000 feet of joint length for each kind of sealant and joint 
substrate. 
 
b. 
Perform one test for each 1000 feet of joint length thereafter or one test per each floor 
per elevation. 
2. 
Test Method: Test joint sealants according to Method A, Field-Applied Sealant Joint Hand 
Pull Tab, in Appendix X1 in ASTM C 1193 or Method A, Tail Procedure, in ASTM C 1521. 
a. 
For joints with dissimilar substrates, verify adhesion to each substrate separately; 
extend cut along one side, verifying adhesion to opposite side. Repeat procedure for 
opposite side. 
3. 
Inspect tested joints and report on the following: 
a. 
Whether sealants filled joint cavities and are free of voids. 
b. 
Whether sealant dimensions and configurations comply with specified requirements. 
c. 
Whether sealants in joints connected to pulled-out portion failed to adhere to joint 
substrates or tore cohesively. Include data on pull distance used to test each kind of 
product and joint substrate. Compare these results to determine if adhesion complies 
with sealant manufacturer's field-adhesion hand-pull test criteria. 
4. 
Record test results in a field-adhesion-test log. Include dates when sealants were installed, 
names of persons who installed sealants, test dates, test locations, whether joints were primed, 
adhesion results and percent elongations, sealant material, sealant configuration, and sealant 
dimensions. 
5. 
Repair sealants pulled from test area by applying new sealants following same procedures 
used originally to seal joints. Ensure that original sealant surfaces are clean and that new 
sealant contacts original sealant. 
B. 
Evaluation of Field-Adhesion-Test Results: Sealants not evidencing adhesive failure from testing or 
noncompliance with other indicated requirements will be considered satisfactory. Remove sealants 
that fail to adhere to joint substrates during testing or to comply with other requirements. Retest 
failed applications until test results prove sealants comply with indicated requirements. 
3.5 
CLEANING 
A. 
Clean off excess sealant or sealant smears adjacent to joints as the Work progresses by methods and

CISCA manual (seismic zone 4) and ASCE/SEI7, and manufacturer's written instructions. 
1. 
Fire-Rated Assembly: Install fire-rated ceiling systems according to tested fire-rated design. 
B. 
Suspend ceiling hangers from building's structural members and as follows: 
1. 
Install hangers plumb and free from contact with insulation or other objects within ceiling plenum 
that are not part of supporting structure or of ceiling suspension system. 
2. 
Splay hangers only where required to miss obstructions; offset resulting horizontal forces by 
bracing, counters playing, or other equally effective means. 
3. 
Where width of ducts and other construction within ceiling plenum produces hanger spacings that 
interfere with location of hangers at spacings required to support standard suspension-system 
members, install supplemental suspension members and hangers in form of trapezes or equivalent 
devices. 
4. 
Secure wire hangers to ceiling suspension members and to supports above with a minimum of 
three tight turns. Connect hangers directly to structure or to inserts, eye screws, or other devices 
that are secure and appropriate for substrate and that will not deteriorate or otherwise fail due to 
age, corrosion, or elevated temperatures. 
5. 
Secure flat, angle, channel, and rod hangers to structure, including intermediate framing members, 
by attaching to inserts, eye screws, or other devices that are secure and appropriate for both the 
structure to which hangers are attached and the type of hanger involved. Install hangers in a 
manner that will not cause them to deteriorate or fail due to age, corrosion, or elevated 
temperatures. 
6. 
Do not support ceilings directly from permanent metal forms or floor deck. Fasten hangers to cast-
in-place hanger inserts, post installed mechanical or adhesive anchors, or power-actuated fasteners 
that extend through forms into concrete.  Power-actuated fasteners are not allowed for diagonal 
seismic wires. 
7. 
When steel framing does not permit installation of hanger wires at spacing required, install 
carrying channels or other supplemental support for attachment of hanger wires. 
8. 
Do not attach hangers to steel deck tabs. 
9. 
Do not attach hangers to steel roof deck. Attach hangers to structural members.

Size supplemental suspension members and hangers to support ceiling loads within performance 
limits established by referenced standards. 
C. 
Secure bracing wires to ceiling suspension members and to supports with a minimum of four tight turns. 
Suspend bracing from building's structural members as required for hangers without attaching to 
permanent metal forms, steel deck, or steel deck tabs. Fasten bracing wires into concrete with cast-in-
place or post installed anchors. 
D. 
Install edge moldings and trim of type indicated at perimeter of acoustical ceiling area and where 
necessary to conceal edges of acoustical tiles. 
 
 
1. 
Apply acoustical sealant in a continuous ribbon concealed on back of vertical legs of moldings 
before they are installed. 
2. 
Screw attach moldings to substrate at intervals no more than 16 inches o.c. and not more than 3 
inches from ends. Miter corners accurately and connect securely. 
3. 
Do not use exposed fasteners, including pop rivets, on moldings and trim. 
E. 
Install suspension-system runners so they are square and securely interlocked with one another. Remove 
and replace dented, bent, or kinked members. 
F. 
Install acoustical tiles in coordination with suspension system and exposed moldings and trim.  
1. 
Fit adjoining tiles to form flush, tight joints. Scribe and cut tiles for accurate fit at borders and 
around penetrations through ceiling. 
2. 
Hold tile field in compression by inserting leaf-type, spring-steel spacers between tiles and 
moldings, spaced 12 inches o.c. 
3. 
Protect lighting fixtures and air ducts according to requirements indicated for fire-resistance-rated 
assembly.

3.5 
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL 
A. 
Perform the following tests and inspections of completed installations of acoustical tile ceiling hangers 
and anchors and fasteners in successive stages and when installation of ceiling suspension systems on 
each floor has reached 20 percent completion, but no tiles have been installed. Do not proceed with 
installations of acoustical tile ceiling hangers for the next area until test results for previously completed 
installations of acoustical tile ceiling hangers show compliance with requirements. 
1. 
Within each test area, testing agency will select one of every 10 power-actuated fasteners and 
postinstalled anchors used to attach hangers to concrete and will test them for 200 lbf of tension; it 
will also select one of every two postinstalled anchors used to attach bracing wires to concrete and 
will test them for 440 lbf of tension. 
2. 
When testing discovers fasteners and anchors that do not comply with requirements, testing 
agency will test those anchors not previously tested until 20 pass consecutively and then will 
resume initial testing frequency. 
B. 
Acoustical tile ceiling hangers, anchors, and fasteners will be considered defective if they do not pass 
tests and inspections. 
C. 
Prepare test and inspection reports. 
 
 
3.6 
ADJUSTING 
A.

3.5. 
STORAGE, SHIPPING AND INSTALLATION 
 
Storage 
 
All equipment, valves, instrumentation, enclosures, and other components shall be stored under cover and out of 
the weather. They shall be protected from contamination by moisture and dirt, and from any other damage by 
foreign objects or from mishandling. This shall also apply to components after being manufactured (e.g., 
platforms, stairs, equipment bases, etc.) and to the finished equipment itself. When not in use, all openings in 
piping, valves, instrumentation, and equipment shall be covered and otherwise sealed against dirt and 
contamination. Proper storage needs to be arranged to allow the equipment to reach the client site during the 
agreed upon window in the purchase contract. 
 
Shipping 
 
Each system shall not be prepared for shipment until all FAT is successfully completed as determined by the 
Owner or Owner's representative. Components subject to corrosion shall be properly protected prior to crating 
and other preparations for shipping to the Owner's facility. Agitators and seals shall be removed from vessels and 
shipped in separate crates. Each system and all sub-components shall be adequately secured, crated, skidded and 
covered to prevent damage during shipment. If piping is cut to allow for shipment where re-welds will be done 
in the field during installation, a spool piece of the proper pipe is to be provided by the manufacturer to allow re-
welding of the line. Appropriate material certifications for these spool pieces must be provided if required. 
Shipping crates and containers shall be properly identified with the project name, purchase order number, Owner’s 
equipment number, complete packing list and shipping information. Crating shall be designed to allow for outside 
storage of each skid for up to one month. Prior to installation, items will be inspected for shipping and storage 
damage, and may be refused and returned if the condition of the items does not meet the satisfaction of the Owner 
or Owner’s representative. 
 
Installation 
 
Site contractors shall receive and install each piece of packaged equipment at the Owner's facility. If indicated on 
the equipment datasheets, the Manufacturer shall provide supervision assistance for the rigging and installation 
of the equipment. Furthermore, the Manufacturer shall be responsible for the re-assembly of sections or 
components of the equipment, if any, including piping, wiring, instrumentation, and any other equipment and 
components shipped separately or in sections. 
 
3.6. 
SITE ACCEPTANCE TESTING 
 
Upon successful shipping and installation by Site Contractor and others at the Owner’s facility, the Owner or 
Owner’s representative may elect to retest any and/or all portions of the equipment package as described in 
Factory Acceptance Testing procedures. Any additional testing agreed to during the Factory Acceptance Testing 
shall be completed at this time. Manufacturer’s representative(s) shall be present for this testing to aid with all 
 
3.7. 
STARTUP AND TRAINING 
 
General 
 
The Manufacturer shall provide start-up and training services as part of the base bid, unless otherwise indicated. 
This shall include, but not be limited to, furnishing the services of a qualified representative to inspect the 
installation of each piece of equipment, perform instrument calibrations, perform start-up of the entire system 
including the control system and verify proper performance of all system components in all applicable modes of 
operation. After successful completion of the system startup, the Manufacturer’s representative shall train the 
Owner’s operating personnel in proper operation of the system including all control functions, and the 
Manufacturer’s recommended cleaning and sanitization procedures. 
 
Startup and training activities shall be indicated on the overall manufacturing schedule to be supplied by the 
Manufacturer. 
 
Start-up and Training 
 
The Manufacturer shall provide start-up assistance and training at the Owner's facility. The manufacturer shall 
recommend the duration and cost of the training in the Bid Proposal as a separate line item. Any additional time 
required by the Owner shall be provided at the Manufacturer's published rates. Field assistance required at the 
site due to faulty workmanship, inoperable controls, or malfunctions of equipment or controls provided by the 
Manufacturer shall not be counted towards the training/start-up allowance. 
 
The Manufacturer training of the Owner's operating and maintenance personnel shall include the following, but 
is not limited to: 
 
• 
Start-up and shut-down procedures. 
• 
Typical operations 
• 
Emergency shutdown 
• 
Safety training  
• 
Troubleshooting procedures 
• 
Control system and instrumentation operation and diagnostics 
• 
Control system hardware maintenance 
• 
Servicing and preventative maintenance schedules and procedures 
 
The Manufacturer shall provide all required training materials electronically and as a hard copy. 
 
3.8. 
VALIDATION 
 
If applicable, the Manufacturer shall provide as an option the cost of providing validation protocols for the 
installation qualification (IQ) and operational qualification (OQ) of the unit. The Manufacturer shall also provide 
as an option the cost of performing the testing and of documenting the test results. The protocols, if used, are 
subject to review by the Owner and agreed upon changes shall be incorporated into the final versions of the 
protocols. The structure and composition of the protocols and their subsequent execution shall comply with 
industry accepted GMP standards and guidelines for critical pharmaceutical operations and systems.

PREPARATION FOR UNDERGROUND DRAINS AND VENTS 
 
Grade trench bottom to provide a smooth, firm, and stable foundation, free from rock, throughout the length of 
the pipe. 
 
Remove unstable, soft, and unsuitable materials at the surface upon which pipes are to be laid and backfill with 
clean sand or pea gravel to indicated invert elevation. 
 
Shape bottom of trench to fit bottom of pipe for 90° (bottom 1/4 of the circumference).  Fill unevenness with 
tamped sand or pea gravel backfill.  At each pipe joint dig bell holes to relieve the bell of the pipe of all loads, 
and to ensure continuous bearing of the pipe barrel on the foundation. 
 
Refer to individual piping system specification data sheet attached. 
 
3.2. 
INSTALLATION 
 
General Locations and Arrangements:  Drawings (plans, schematics, and diagrams) indicate the general location 
and arrangement of the piping systems.  Location and arrangement of piping layout take into account many design 
considerations.  So far as practical, install piping as indicated. 
 
Use fittings for all changes in direction and all branch connections. 
 
 
Provide pipe sleeves 2 pipe sizes larger than service pipe when penetrating floors, foundations and structural 
walls. 
 
Make changes in direction for drainage and vent piping using appropriate 45° wyes, half-wyes, or long sweep 
quarter, sixth, eighth, or sixteenth bends.  Sanitary tees or short quarter bends may be used on vertical stacks of 
drainage lines where the change in direction of flow is from horizontal to vertical, except use long-turn tees where 
two (2) fixtures are installed back to back and have a common drain.  Straight tees, elbows, and crosses may be 
used on vent lines.  No change in direction of flow greater than 90° shall be made. 
 
Where different sizes of drainage pipes and fittings are connected, use proper size, standard increasers and 
reducers.  Reduction of the size of drainage piping in the direction of flow is prohibited. 
 
Install underground building drains to conform with the plumbing code, and in accordance with the Cast Iron Soil 
Pipe Institute Engineering Manual.  Lay underground drains beginning at low point of systems, true to grades and 
alignment indicated with unbroken continuity of invert.  Place bell ends of piping facing upstream.  Install 
required gaskets in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations for use of lubricants, cements, and other 
special installation requirements.  Maintain swab or drag in line and pull past each joint as it is completed. 
 
Install building drain pitched down at minimum slope of 1/4" per foot (2%) for piping 3" and smaller, and 1/8" 
per foot (1%) for piping 4" and larger, unless otherwise noted. 
 
3.3. 
INSTALLATION OF PIPING SPECIALTIES 
 
Drainage Specialties:  Install drainage specialties, in locations indicated, and as required by the plumbing code.  
Install in accordance to manufacturer's recommendations. 
 
3.4. 
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL 
 
Piping System Test:  Test systems in accordance with the procedures of the authority having jurisdiction, or in 
the absence of a published procedure, as follows: 
 
Test for leaks and defects all piping systems and parts of existing systems, which have been altered, extended or 
repaired.  If testing is performed in segments, submit a separate report for each test, complete with a diagram of 
the portion of the system tested. 
 
Leave uncovered and unconcealed all new, altered, extended, or replaced piping until it has been tested and 
approved.  Expose all such work for testing that has been covered or concealed before it has been tested and 
approved. 
 
Rough Plumbing Test Procedure:  Except for outside leaders and perforated or open jointed drain tile, test the 
piping of systems upon completion of the rough piping installation.  Tightly close all openings in the piping 
system, and fill with water to the point of overflow, but not less than 10 feet head of water.  Water level shall not 
drop during the period from 15 minutes before the inspection starts, through completion of the inspection.  Inspect 
all joints for leaks. 
 
Repair all leaks and defects using new materials and retest system or portion thereof until satisfactory results are 
obtained. 
 
Prepare reports for all tests and required corrective action. 
 
3.5. 
ADJUSTING AND CLEANING 
 
Clean interior of piping system.  Remove dirt and debris as work progresses.

between pipe anchors and to facilitate action of expansion joints, expansion loops, expansion bends and similar 
units, if provided. 
 
Load Distribution:  Install hangers and supports so that piping live and dead loading and stresses from movement 
will not be transmitted to connected equipment, and so that maximum pipe deflections allowed by the current 
ANSI B31 Pressure Piping Codes are not exceeded. 
 
Pipe Slopes:  Install hangers and supports to provide indicated pipe slopes. 
 
3.3. 
INSTALLATION OF BUILDING ATTACHMENTS

points of support for pipe sizes 4" and less, for first four points of support for pipe sizes 6" through 8", and for 
first six (6) points of support for pipe sizes 10" and over.  Locate isolation hangers as near overhead support 
structure as possible.  Weld riser isolator units in place as required too prevent displacement from loading and 
operations. 
Install the following pipe attachments: 
 
Unless indicated otherwise, for services that operate at 150° F and above, use roller hangers and protective 
saddles.  For services below this temperature, use clevis hangers and protection shields.  All shields and protective 
saddles to comply with MSS-58 and manufacturer’s recommendation. Insulation shields or saddles installed 
between roller hangers and the insulation must be secured to the insulation to prevent falling if the roller hanger

1. These pipe insulation thicknesses meet all the requirements of the 2018, 2015, 2012, 2009 and 2006 International 
Codes, the 2019, 2016, 2013 and 2010 ASHRAE 90.1 standard, the 2019, 2016 and 2013 California Title 24 codes, 
condensation control and personnel protection.  They are based on the thermal conductivity as listed in specification 
230250 datasheets.                                                                           . 
If the Contractor is proposing materials with higher conductivity, then greater thicknesses may be required, and the 
Contractor shall provide calculations to the Engineer for review and approval.   
2. Index temperature ranges for piping are not necessarily the actual fluid temperature, but rather they are the 
temperature ranges selected by the Engineer upon which to base insulation thickness.  Differences between actual 
fluid temperature and chosen index temperature may account for factors such as transient room temperature and 
humidity situations.  See the Piping Systems Application Table in specification 230500 for required index 
temperatures for each fluid type.   
3. Do not use calcium silicate insulation on piping with fluids colder than 80F in any location, or on piping with fluids 
60F or below where it is located outdoors in humid climates, unless approved by the Engineer.   
4. For thermal conductivities different than the values in specification datasheets, the minimum thickness (T) shall 
be determined as follows:  
T = r{(1 + t/r)K/k – 1}, where  
T = minimum insulation thickness (in.),  
r = actual outside radius of pipe (in.),   
t = insulation thickness listed in this table for applicable index temperature and pipe size,  
K = thermal conductivity of proposed insulation material at mean rating temperature between the applicable index 
temperature and the room temperature, (Btu-inch./[h•ft2•°F]); and  
k = thermal conductivity listed in the applicable insulation datasheet for the same mean temperature between the 
applicable index temperature and the room temperature, (Btu-inch./[h•ft2•°F])

Piping Insulation Notes: 
1. These pipe insulation thicknesses (not including the two “Plumb” columns) meet all the requirements of the 2018, 
2015, 2012, 2009 and 2006 International Codes, the 2019, 2016, 2013 and 2010 ASHRAE 90.1 standard, the 
2019, 2016 and 2013 California Title 24 codes, condensation control and personnel protection.  They are based 
on 
the 
thermal 
conductivity 
as 
listed 
in 
specification 
230250 
datasheets.  
The “Plumb 40 to 60” column can be used where the code in force doesn’t have a thickness requirement.   
The “Plumb 61 to 104” column can be used for a) service water heating where the 2009 or 2006 IECC or 2019 
or 2016 California Title 24 codes do not apply and where the applicable code in force allows these thickness 
values, and b) for other services where the code in force allows these thickness values.  Refer to the Piping 
Systems 
Application 
Table 
for 
required 
insulation 
thicknesses 
for 
specific 
piping 
services.                    
If the Contractor is proposing materials with higher conductivity, then greater thicknesses may be required, and 
the Contractor shall provide calculations to the Engineer for review and approval.   
2. Index temperature ranges for piping are not necessarily the actual fluid temperature, but rather they are the 
temperature ranges selected by the Engineer upon which to base insulation thickness.  Differences between actual 
fluid temperature and chosen index temperature may account for factors such as transient room temperature and 
humidity situations.  See the Piping Systems Application Table in specification 230500 for required index 
temperatures for each fluid type.   
3. Do not use fiberglass insulation on piping with fluids colder than 40F in any location, or on piping with fluids 
60F or below where it is located outdoors in humid climates, unless approved by the Engineer.   
4. For thermal conductivities different than the values in specification datasheets, the minimum thickness (T) shall 
be determined as follows:  
T = r{(1 + t/r)K/k – 1}, where  
T = minimum insulation thickness (in.), r = actual outside radius of pipe (in.),   
t = insulation thickness listed in this table for applicable index temperature and pipe size,  
K = thermal conductivity of proposed insulation material at mean rating temperature between the applicable 
index temperature and the room temperature, (Btu-inch./[h•ft2•°F]); and  
k = thermal conductivity listed in the applicable insulation datasheet for the same mean temperature between the 
applicable index temperature and the room temperature, (Btu-inch./[h•ft2•°F])

Piping Insulation Notes: 
1. These pipe insulation thicknesses meet all the requirements of the 2018, 2015, 2012, 2009 and 2006 International 
Codes, the 2019, 2016, 2013 and 2010 ASHRAE 90.1 standard, the 2019, 2016 and 2013 California Title 24 
codes, condensation control and personnel protection.  They are based on the thermal conductivity as listed in 
specification 230250 datasheets.                                                                                  .  
If the Contractor is proposing materials with higher conductivity, then greater thicknesses may be required, and 
the Contractor shall provide calculations to the Engineer for review and approval.   
2. Index temperature ranges for piping are not necessarily the actual fluid temperature, but rather they are the 
temperature ranges selected by the Engineer upon which to base insulation thickness.  Differences between actual 
fluid temperature and chosen index temperature may account for factors such as transient room temperature and 
humidity situations.  See the Piping Systems Application Table in specification 230500 for required index 
temperatures for each fluid type.   
3. For thermal conductivities different than the values in specification datasheets, the minimum thickness (T) shall 
be determined as follows:  
T = r{(1 + t/r)K/k – 1}, where  
T = minimum insulation thickness (in.),  
r = actual outside radius of pipe (in.),   
t = insulation thickness listed in this table for applicable index temperature and pipe size,  
K = thermal conductivity of proposed insulation material at mean rating temperature between the applicable 
index temperature and the room temperature, (Btu-inch./[h•ft2•°F]); and  
k = thermal conductivity listed in the applicable insulation datasheet for the same mean temperature between the 
applicable index temperature and the room temperature, (Btu-inch./[h•ft2•°F])

Vessels V101, V102, and V103 cannot be overpressurized in a CIP cycle scenario, the system 
volume for CIP fluids is less than the total volume of the vessels. This is primarily sized for the 
coincidence that vessel V201, V202, or V203 is overfilled with CIP fluids. In an overfill scenario 
for vessels V101, V102, and V103, we would see compressed air overpressurization at a 
maximum of 50 psig and a required relief area of less than 4.91 sqin.

PART 3. - EXECUTION 
 
3.1. 
GENERAL 
 
3.1.1. 
Piping Arrangement 
 
Piping shall be installed per the drawings.  Route piping at right angles or parallel to the building structure, free 
of sags or bends, and grouped together wherever possible.  Locate groups of pipes parallel to each other, spaced 
to permit applying full insulation and servicing of valves.  Diagonal runs are not permitted, unless expressly 
indicated on the drawings or approved isometric. 
 
Arrange piping to allow for ease of access to components that will be serviced regularly as part of the intended 
operation of the equipment, including the removal of filter housings and valve actuators, and the calibration of 
instrumentation.  Where piping is installed in clean manufacturing areas, sufficient space between piping (or 
insulation on insulated piping) shall be provided to allow for cleaning and shall not be less than 1”. 
 
Arrange supports and piping directional changes to allow for thermal expansion in the piping systems due to 
normal temperature changes.  Avoid creating, even temporarily, undue loads, forces, or strains on valves, 
instrumentation, equipment connections, supports, structural framing, or building components caused by piping 
connections or supports. 
 
Allow sufficient space above removable ceiling panels to allow for panel removal. 
 
Provide equipment connections with hygienic clamps, compression end, flanged, or threaded connections with 
unions, based upon the piping material and system, unless otherwise indicated, to allow for complete removal of 
the equipment without disruption of the connected piping system. 
 
Install drains at low points in piping mains, risers, and branch lines consisting of valve types per section 2.5 of 
this specification and the system data sheets.  Provide caps at ends of valves. 
 
Install air vents at high points of hydronic systems for system air venting, unless otherwise specified. 
 
 
Install final piping, unions, and flanges at connections to all equipment and fixtures in such a manner that will 
permit the complete removal of any fixtures or components, such as coils, tube bundles, or filters without cutting 
pipelines (e.g., through the uses of swing elbows). 
 
Install instrumentation and other control devices in piping systems where indicated on the drawings. 
 
3.1.2. 
P&ID Drawings 
 
When Process and Instrumentation Diagrams are provided, they shall be adhered to as much as possible and 
practical, as they indicate the desired relative locations of piping components, flow paths, and equipment 
connections to achieve the proper process operations.  Where conflicts arise between the P&IDs and other 
drawings and specifications, notify the Owner and Owner’s representative for clarification. 
 
3.1.3. 
Piping Plan and Elevation Drawings 
 
When piping plan and elevation drawings are provided, they indicate the general location and arrangement of the 
piping systems and associated valves and components.  Location and arrangement of piping layout take into 
consideration pipe sizing and friction loss, thermal expansion, pump sizing, and other design considerations.  To 
the extent possible and practical, install piping as indicated.   
 
3.1.4. 
Pipe Penetrations 
 
Install sleeves for piping passing through penetrations in floors, partitions, roofs and walls.  Cut sleeves to length 
for mounting flush with both surfaces, unless otherwise indicated on drawings.   
• 
Piping 6” and smaller shall use pipe sleeves; piping larger than 6” shall use sheet-metal sleeves.  
• 
Select sleeves of size large enough to provide 1” annular clear space between pipe or pipe insulation and 
concrete slabs and walls. 
• 
Select sleeves of size large enough to provide ¼” annular clear space between pipe or pipe insulation 
and interior partitions. 
• 
Seal annular space between sleeve and piping or piping insulation; use joint sealants appropriate for size, 
depth, and location of joint. 
• 
Piping located in exterior walls below grade shall use mechanical-sleeve-seal. 
 
All pipe penetrations through clean room walls and ceilings, including all clean manufacturing spaces, shall be 
sealed using clean room wall/ceiling pipe penetration boots.  Boots shall be installed on the pipe on the clean 
room side of the penetration, prior to the addition of valves and fittings that would prevent the installation of the 
boot and final positioning against the penetration.  Where pipes penetrate a wall between 2 clean rooms, a boot 
shall be installed on both side of the wall, and piping insulation installed between the boots to completely insulate 
the pipe. 
 
All pipe penetrations through non-clean room walls and ceilings shall be provided with an escutcheon on each 
side of the wall.  The penetration shall be sealed with insulation and sealant.  Install sealants by proven techniques 
that result in sealants directly contacting joints edges, completely filling recesses provided for each joint 
configuration, and providing uniform, cross sectional shapes and depths relative to joint widths which allow 
optimum sealant movement capability. 
 
The smallest size boot that can adequately seal the pipe to the wall/ceiling surface shall be used.  Pipes shall be 
spaced to prevent interference between the boot ceiling rings of adjacent pipes.  No sealant shall be used between 
the boot and the wall/ceiling surface. 
 
Where fire stop sealants are required to meet applicable codes for pipe penetrations through fire rated walls and 
ceilings, the sealants shall be applied to the penetration prior to the attachment of the boot or escutcheon to the 
wall/ceiling surface. 
 
 
sheathing on the clean room side tight to the ceiling and cut it back on the dirty side to allow the insulation to be 
extended tight to the inside of the boot.   
 
If pipe is insulated the insulation shall be continuous through the escutcheon in non-clean room areas. 
 
3.1.5. 
Preparation

and critical liquid systems, installed with the straight side down unless indicated otherwise.  Vertical lines shall 
use concentric reducer fittings. 
 
Use fittings for all changes in direction and all branch connections except where bending is specifically allowed 
by the piping material data sheet.  Use long radius elbows unless indicated otherwise, or unless required due to 
space constraints. 
 
3.1.7. 
Branch Connections 
 
Branch connection types shall comply with branch connection tables in the piping material data sheets.

Connections and Joints 
 
All piping connections and joints shall be made in accordance with appropriate ASME B31 Piping Code sections.  
The types of joints and connections in a piping system shall be as indicated on the drawings and elsewhere in the 
project specifications.  Welded joints are preferred and shall be used wherever possible and practical, complying 
with AWS procedures and standards. 
 
Joints indicated as being soldered on copper systems may be brazed on larger sizes if the contractor believes a 
better joint will be the result.  Brazed joints shall be in accordance with AWS standards C3.3, C3.4, C5.10, and 
D10.13.  Filler material shall be AWS A5.8 BCuP-5 silver copper-phosphorus (15% Ag, 80% Cu, 5% P, nominal 
composition), and shall otherwise meet the material requirements indicated for that system on the piping data 
sheet (e.g., lead free for potable water systems).  This approach shall be submitted for approval per system prior 
to use. 
 
At the final connection to each piece of equipment, adjacent to each control valve or where indicated on drawings, 
install flanges in piping 2½” and larger and unions in piping 2” and smaller.   
 
Assemble flange joints by sequencing bolt tightening to make initial contact of flanges and gaskets as flat and 
parallel as possible.  Tighten bolts gradually to uniformly compress the gaskets and minimize flange stress. Use 
a calibrated torque wrench to tighten flange and flange bolts to torque specified by manufacturer. 
 
 
are the only ones available, raised face shall be removed by grinding to a smooth flat surface prior to assembly of 
the joint. 
 
3.1.9.

system shut down.  A union connection shall be installed as close as possible to each screwed or soldered end 
valve. 
 
Install check valves as indicated on the drawings, and for proper direction of flow, oriented to ensure that the 
valve will close freely and positively under normal operating conditions.  Allow a minimum of five pipe diameters 
upstream of check valves to minimize chatter and to extend valve life, unless indicated otherwise.  Wafer and duo 
check valves shall be installed between flanges with a horizontal or vertical orientation.  Lift check valves shall 
be installed the stem upright and plumb. 
 
Ball valves with vented balls shall be installed so that when the valve is closed, the interior of the valve is vented 
to the upstream, pressurized side of the valve, unless indicated otherwise in the specifications or drawings. 
 
3.1.10. Dielectric Unions 
 
Provide dielectric unions with appropriate end connections for the pipe systems in which installed (screwed, 
soldered, or flanged), which effectively isolate dissimilar metals, prevent galvanic action, and stop corrosion.  
Dielectric unions are not required for joining stainless steel to carbon steel for aqueous solutions in indoor 
controlled environments.  All dielectric unions are to be installed in accessible locations. 
 
3.1.11. Steam and Condensate Piping Installation

indicated.  Install condensate return piping at a uniform grade of 1/2" in 10’ downward in the direction of flow, 
unless indicated otherwise.  Steam branch lines that extend less than 10’ from the main header can be pitched 
back towards the header if required to simplify installation. 
 
Install drip legs where indicated on the drawings, as well as at low points and natural drainage points in the system 
such as at the bottoms of risers, ends of mains, and ahead of pressure regulators, control valves, isolation valves, 
thermal expansion loops, and expansion joints.  On straight runs with no natural drainage points, install drip legs 
at intervals not exceeding 200’ where pipe is pitched down in the direction of the steam flow and a maximum of 
150’ where the pipe is pitched up so that condensate flow is opposite of steam flow. 
 
Size drip legs at vertical risers’ full size and extend below the drip trap piping to form a dirt leg.  Size drip legs at 
other locations with the same diameter as the main up to 6".  In steam mains 6" and larger, provide drip legs sized 
1/2 the size of the main, but not less than 6".  Drip leg length shall be 1.5 times the pipe size, but not less than 
18", and the dirt leg shall extend at least 6" below the steam trap piping. 
 
Strainers shall be installed upstream of all control valves and steam traps.  Strainers shall be oriented with both 
flow and blow down branches horizontal and level.

shall follow the cleaning step and shall completely remove all of the detergent solution from the system.  Removal 
of the solution shall be coordinated with the Owner.  Cleaning shall be considered complete when a sample of the 
discharge indicates no residual detergent solution and a pH of 6.5 to 7.5. 
 
3.1.13. Passivation (Stainless Steel Systems Only) 
 
After the completion of all welding and polishing operations and successful pressure testing, flushing, and 
cleaning, all piping and components in stainless steel systems shall be passivated, unless the stainless steel system 
is for gas or compressed air type systems.  Refer to the Piping System Application Table for passivation 
requirement per system.

valves for branch lines.  Valves shall be configured and installed to provide for complete drainability. 
 
3.3. 
QUALITY CONTROL 
 
3.3.1. 
Pressure Testing 
 
General 
 
After the completion of all welding, fabrication and polishing operations, but prior to insulating, all piping systems 
shall be pressure tested using the test procedure as indicated within the Piping System Application Table (PSAT) 
and as specified herein.    No testing shall be performed without being witnessed by the Owner or the Owner’s 
representative, who shall be notified 48 hours in advance of the test.  Owner reserves the right to decline to witness 
the pressure testing.  All testing procedures shall be approved by the Owner prior to the start of testing.  All testing 
procedures and acceptance criteria must satisfy the corresponding code indicated in the PSAT per system. 
 
Equipment, instruments and components that are not rated for the test pressure shall be isolated from the piping 
system during pressure tests.  If a valve is used to isolate components, its closure shall be capable of sealing 
against the test pressure without damage to the isolated component. 
Provide temporary restraints for expansion joints which cannot sustain the reactions due to test pressure.  If 
temporary restraints are not practical, isolate expansion joints from testing. 
 
Joints at which blinds are inserted to isolate equipment need not be tested. 
 
In each system to be tested, install relief valves set at a pressure of no more than 1/3 higher than the test pressure 
to protect against damage by expansion of liquid or other source of overpressure during the test. 
 
Refer to the Piping System Applications Table (PSAT) for the type of fluid to be used as the pressure testing 
medium.    Compressed air and/or nitrogen for all pneumatic pressure tests shall be of the quality as described in 
Section 3.1.12 under Preparation.  The pressure testing apparatus shall be constructed of materials that are

commercial preparation made specifically for leak detection.  Soap solutions used on ASME BPE piping systems 
constructed of stainless steel shall be low chloride type. 
 
Provide a temporary test pump, storage tank and other accessories as required to achieve the test pressures 
specified where not available on site. 
 
Test Pressures 
 
Refer to the attached Piping System Applications Table for the piping system test pressure to be used.   
 
Test Acceptance 
 
A test will be considered acceptable when all of the conditions of this specification have been met and the test 
pressure does not change more than 2.0% during the stated test duration.  It is required that an Owner designated 
representative be present to witness and sign for test acceptance. 
 
Provide pressure test documentation including: 
 
Date of test 
Identification of piping system tested. 
Test fluid 
Test pressure 
Test results 
Identities of Test Witnesses 
 
Hydrostatic Testing Procedure 
 
1. With written approval by Owner, prior to hydrostatic pressure testing, the Contractor has the option to 
perform a low pressure pneumatic pressure test.  If the Contractor wishes to perform this preliminary 
test, Steps 1 through 4 shall be followed from the “Pneumatic Testing Procedure” outlined below.  Upon 
completion of a successful leak check at the pressure in Step 4, the system shall be released of pressure 
and the remaining steps for Hydrostatic Testing Procedure shall be performed.  For this preliminary test, 
Contractor shall utilize particulate, moisture and oil free air or nitrogen gas of qualities as described in 
Section 3.1.12 under Preparation. 
 
2. Fill the piping system with appropriate water from a storage tank or other approved source.  Owner or 
Owner's representative shall approve water quality and source for use with hydrostatic pressure tests. 
 
3. Bleed the system of entrained gases. 
 
4. Circulate the water through the system using a circulating pump for a period of not less than one hour. 
 
5. Inspect all piping for leaks during circulation of water. 
 
6. Slowly close a temporary valve on the discharge side of the piping system. 
 
7. When the test pressure is obtained at the discharge of the pump, the pump shall be shut down and the 
discharge valve closed.  If the circulation pump is not capable of producing the test pressure required for 
the piping system, provisions shall be made for pressurizing the water filled system with particulate, 
moisture and oil free air or nitrogen gas of a quality as defined in Section 3.1.12 under Preparation, or a 
hand pump. 
 
8. Leaks shall be marked and repaired according to the joining methods specified for the piping system 
being tested. 
 
9. After leaks are repaired, the entire system shall be tested again as specified above. 
 
10. Repeat test procedure until the system is proven tight at test pressure to the satisfaction of the Owner or 
Owner's Representative. 
 
11. Hydrostatic test pressure shall be maintained for a sufficient length of time to visually determine whether 
there are any leaks, but not less than 1 hour.  The Contractor shall not be required to maintain test pressure 
in excess of 2 hours after notification of the Owner’s authorized inspector. 
 
12. If start up is not scheduled to occur within 12 hours after hydrostatic testing, the system shall be 
completely drained and purged with clean, filtered oil-free, dry air. 
 
Pneumatic Testing Procedure 
 
1. Clear the test area of non-essential personnel before bringing the line pressure up to test pressure.  The 
 
pneumatic testing as this testing procedure is inherently dangerous. 
 
2. A pressure relief device shall be provided, having a set pressure not higher than the test pressure plus the 
lesser of 50 psig or 10% of the test pressure. 
 
3. A double block and bleed valve arrangement shall be included in the pressurizing line to the system 
being tested.  A test gauge shall be located downstream of the double block valve assembly.   
 
4. When pneumatic testing over 25 psig, a preliminary check at 10 psig shall be made to locate major leaks.  
Examination of the system may be visual or audible.  Visual examinations shall utilize a soap solution 
in order to detect the leakage.   
 
5. After the preliminary check, the test pressure shall be increased in stages of not more than 25% up to 
full pneumatic test pressure, allowing time for equalization of strains and detection of leaks at each stage.   
If after a minimum 10-minute period the pressure is held, proceed to the next pressure.   
 
6. If the pressure is not held, examine the entire system for leakage.  Examination of the system shall be 
visual utilizing a soap solution to detect the leakage.  All leaks found shall be marked and repaired after 
first depressurizing the line.  After leaks have been repaired, the pressure test shall be repeated.  All leaks 
which have been repaired shall be visually reexamined, with soap, to assure proper repair.   
 
7. After the system has been successfully brought up to the test pressure, the pressure shall then be held for 
a 10-minute period.  After this period, the pressure shall be reduced to the design pressure and held for 
a duration of 24 hours.    
 
8. Bolting shall not be tightened while systems are being tested above 30 psig. 
 
3.3.2. 
Weld/Brazing Inspections 
 
General 
 
Welds and brazed connections shall be inspected per the applicable ASME code identified in the PSAT per 
system.  Inspections shall be performed and documented by a qualified 3rd party, separate from the installation 
contractor.  Welds and brazed connections that do not pass inspection shall be removed from the system.  If 
ASME BPE is indicated in the PSAT, then Chapter X of ASME B31.3 is implied for weld and/or brazed 
inspection.  For piping systems indicated as ASME B31.3 or ASME BPE, utilize the appropriate chapter based 
on the classified fluid service indicated in the PSAT. 
 
The interior of all welds or brazing performed in a shop environment shall be inspected. 
 
ASME BPE Specific Requirements 
 
Examinations shall be performed and documented by the installation contractor per BPE. 
 
The exterior of all welds shall be visually examined by a Level II qualified inspector and documented in the weld 
log.   
 
Welds that do not pass examinations shall either be removed from the system or re-welded in accordance with 
the latest version of the ASME BPE. 
 
Inspections shall be performed and documented by a qualified 3rd party, separate from the installation contractor.  
If ASME BPE is indicated in the PSAT, then Chapter X of ASME B31.3 is implied for weld inspection.  For 
piping systems indicated as ASME B31.3, utilize the appropriate chapter based on the classified fluid service 
indicated in the PSAT. 
 
The interior of welded joints shall be inspected using a borescope.  All borescope inspections shall be 
electronically recorded, and copies of the recordings shall be provided to the Owner.  Welds that do not pass 
examinations shall either be removed from the system or re-welded in accordance with the latest version of ASME 
BPE. 
 
The inspection plan by the inspection contractor shall include no less than 20% borescope of the welds in each 
system installed.  Initially, the interior of all welds performed in the field shall be inspected.  After an individual 
welder performs 25 consecutive welds with no rejections, the weld interior inspection rate may be reduced to the 
minimum agreed upon with Owner but no less than 20%.  Each of the minimum 20% borescope welds shall have 
video capture as documentation of that inspected weld.  Upon rejection of any weld, the weld interior inspection 
rate shall increase to all welds, and the accepted weld count shall be reset to zero. 
 
If it is physically impossible to perform a borescope inspection of a weld, an actual configuration coupon (butt-
butt coupon) weld just prior to and after completing the blind weld shall be performed, and subsequently inspected 
for approval or rejection by the weld inspector. 
 
The interior of brazed joints shall be direct visual inspected per BPE code.  The Owner and Contractor shall agree 
upon a minimum percentage of brazed joints for inspection. 
 
3.3.3. 
Weld/Brazing Examinations

When indicated as required on the pump data sheet, provide a self-contained control system meeting the 
requirements indicated. 
 
The Manufacturer shall warrant that all wiring and electrical components complies with the NEC, applicable UL 
requirements, and all applicable local electrical codes.  All wiring and components shall be rated appropriately, 
UL listed, and suitable for the environment in which the equipment is installed. 
 
For electrically driven pumps: In addition to the control requirements indicated on the data sheet, adequate 
controls shall be provided to allow for the full, proper, safe and intended operation of the equipment.  Interlocks 
shall be provided to prevent the unit from being operated outside its design envelope and set points, as well as for 
safety. 
 
All controls shall be installed in an electrical enclosure meeting indicated requirements.  Unless indicated 
otherwise, each enclosure shall be configured with the following components as a minimum: 
 
• 
Power or air switch 
• 
Power on or air on light 
• 
HAND/OFF/AUTO switch for electrically driven pumps 
• 
Alarm light 
• 
Reset button 
• 
Run light 
 
If local speed control is indicated as required, the VFD shall be mounted in the electrical enclosure, and the 
appropriate speed indicator and controls shall be mounted on the door of the enclosure to allow local operator 
 
The electrical enclosure shall be provided with a lockable disconnect switch on the door that will de-energize the 
system upon opening the door, unless indicated otherwise. 
 
 
PART 3. -  EXECUTION 
 
3.1. 
ASSEMBLY, STORAGE AND SHIPPING 
 
Assemble pumps in a clean area, and to the greatest extent possible, prevent the contamination of the interior of 
the pump with dirt and debris.  Clean finished pump assembly appropriately. 
 
Pump and motor assemblies that are indicated to be provided on a manufacturer/vendor supplied base shall be 
pre-assembled as such, including proper pump alignment, rotational checks, lubrication, painting and cleaning. 
 
Keep all openings on pumps capped and sealed whenever possible during assembly and installation operations, 
while in storage, and after installation but prior to connection to piping systems. 
 
After assembly and testing, clean piping connections and exposed machined metal surfaces and treat with an anti-
corrosion compound.  Protect flanges, pipe openings and nozzles.  Plug gauge, drain and vent taps. 
 
3.2. 
INSTALLATION 
 
3.2.1. 
Examination 
 
Examine areas, equipment foundations and conditions, with installer present, for compliance with requirements 
for installation tolerances and other conditions affecting performance of pumps. 
 
Examine rough-in for piping systems to verify actual locations of piping connections prior to installation. 
 
Do not proceed until unsatisfactory conditions have been corrected. 
 
3.2.2. 
Installation 
 
Install pumps as indicated on the drawings and as specified herein, and comply with the manufacturer's written 
installation and alignment instructions. 
 
Install pumps in locations and arrange to provide access for periodic maintenance, including removal of motors, 
impellers, couplings and accessories. 
 
Support pumps and piping separately so that the weight of the piping system does not rest on the pump. 
 
Suspend inline pumps using hanger rod and vibration isolation hangers of sufficient size to support the weight of 
the pump independent from the piping system, or from the floor using a pipe and pedestal mount, per the 
manufacturer's recommendations. 
 
Set base-mounted pumps on concrete foundations, unless otherwise indicated.  For pumps that are not close 
coupled or pre-assembled on a baseplate, disconnect coupling halves before setting.  Do not reconnect couplings 
until the alignment operations have been completed. 
 
Support pump bases on rectangular metal blocks and shims, or on metal wedges having a small taper, at points 
near the foundation bolts to provide a gap of 3/4 to 1-1/2" between the pump base and the foundation for grouting. 
 
Adjust the metal supports or wedges until the shafts of the pump and driver are level.  Check the coupling faces 
and suction and discharge flanges of the pump to verify that they are level and plumb.  After proper alignment 
 
3.2.3. 
Alignment 
 
Align pump and motor shafts (on pumps that are not close coupled or pre-assemble assemblies only), and piping 
connections after setting on foundations and piping connections have been made, but before grout has been set, 
and foundation bolts have been tightened. 
 
After alignment is correct, tighten the foundation bolts evenly, but not too firmly.  Fill the base plate completely 
with no shrink nonmetallic grout, with metal blocks and shims or wedges in place.  After grout has cured, fully 
tighten foundation bolts. 
 
Alignment tolerances shall meet manufacturer's recommendations. 
 
3.3. 
CONNECTIONS 
 
Install valves, piping and other accessories as indicated on the drawings and data sheets.  Provide swing elbows 
and sufficient fittings to allow pumps casings to be easily removed and installed for maintenance without the need 
to disturb adjoining piping. 
 
3.4. 
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL 
 
Check line connections for tightness to avoid drawing air into the pump or leakage on discharge. 
 
3.5. 
START-UP 
 
Perform preventative maintenance operations and checks in accordance with the recommendations of the pump 
manufacturer before start-up.  Lubricate lubricated type bearings.  Check motor for proper rotation.  Rotation 
shall match direction of rotation marked on pump casing. Clean strainers.  Check that pumps are free to rotate by 
hand.  For pumps handling hot liquids, pump shall be free to rotate with the pump hot and cold.  If the pump is 
bound or even drags slightly, do not operate the pump until the cause of the trouble is determined  and corrected. 
 
Start-up pumps in accordance with manufacturer's start-up procedures and recommendations.

General 
 
Testing shall consist of two (2) types:  BAS Contractor testing and Owner acceptance testing. 
 
Assemblies and subassemblies shall be factory tested in accordance with BAS Contractor standard quality 
assurance program.  This testing shall be done prior to site acceptance tests. 
 
Site Acceptance Test 
 
After the system is delivered and installed in the Owner’s facility, the system shall go through site acceptance test 
(S.A.T.).  The S.A.T. will be concurrent with the BAS Instrument Commissioning.  All documentation associated 
with BAS Contractor testing and the Owner’s acceptance testing shall be supplied to the Owner for his inclusion 
in the Validation Documentation where applicable. 
 
Field Tests:  The field tests shall begin after the BAS Contractor’s personnel have installed, started, and 
checked out the performance of the BAS equipment at the field location.  Before any field-testing is 
started, the BAS Contractor shall verify that all hardware has been updated with the latest engineering 
changes.  If any updates have been omitted that are deemed necessary to meet the specification, the BAS 
Contractor shall immediately perform the necessary modifications at no cost to the Owner.  BAS 
contractor shall also document the point-to-point checkouts completed for the entire system. 
 
Site Acceptance Test (S.A.T.):  Following installation of the BAS system, all hardware shall be aligned 
and adjusted, and all test readings recorded in accordance with the BAS Contractor’s recommended tests 
and maintenance procedures.  The BAS Contractor shall include, in the associated test report, a list of 
all hardware or components replaced or changed between the completion of the factory tests and the start 
of field installation tests.  All hardware shall be demonstrated to be operational by running the off-line 
diagnostics.  The BAS Contractor and Owner shall determine the exact contents of the field installation 
test jointly.  The S.A.T. test shall be considered complete only after all variances generated during 
installation are resolved and tested. 
 
Startup Test and Punch Out:  Prior to on-line operation, conduct a complete demonstration and readout 
of the computer’s real-time responsibilities of surveillance and control.  Demonstration of controls may 
include simulation of analog inputs (via the system keyboard or by applying an analog signal to 
appropriate control panels input terminals) and observation of the action of system final control elements.  
 
Perform punch out of all input/output points.  Conduct startup test and punch out in the presence of 
Owner and the Owner’s Representative. 
 
After Owner approved calibration documents have been reviewed, the BAS Contractor shall demonstrate 
all control sequences function as specified and the performance of each control loop is within specific 
limits.  Graphical trends shall be recorded and printed for each control loop as to verify the loop stability 
is within the specified performance limits.  Each trend shall be for duration of not less than two (2) hours. 
 
The Owner shall be notified no later than five (5) days prior to scheduled startup testing. 
 
Operational Acceptance Test:  After all previous testing has been successfully completed; operate the 
BAS, for 14 days Minimum.  Provide the Owner with a bound log reporting all BAS failures that occur 
during the operating acceptance test.  The log shall show the point name and number, time and date of 
failure, and time and date of return to service.  Additionally, during the 14-day acceptance test, any 
operational failures due to malfunction of the control panels, wiring, or Control room Equipment shall 
designate a restart to testing if desired by the Owner.  Any failure between field-sensing equipment and 
the controllers shall be corrected, and the testing shall continue from the day of failure.  The Owner shall 
determine the duration of all retests.  If the season of the year prevents complete testing of any individual 
component(s) of the BAS, then acceptance will be conditional upon the successful demonstration of the 
specific component(s) at the appropriate season.  
 
Required Control Tolerances

zone temperature and humidity controllers as follows: 
 
Each control zone has temperature and humidity transmitters located in the return duct from the controlled 
room. 
 
Software modules/controllers shall account for Temp and Humidity transmitter failed events. 
 
The temperature signal is fed through two (2) software controllers. One is set for the summer cooling set point, 
the other for the winter heating set point. 
 
Similarly the humidity signal is fed through two (2) software controllers.  One is set for dehumidification set 
point, the other for the humidification set point. 
The output from the cooling controller and the dehumidification controller are compared and the higher signal 
of the two from each zone is fed to a second high signal selector, the output of which is used to reset the chilled 
water coil discharge temperature temperature set point. 
 
In this manner the supply air is cooled only enough to satisfy the cooling or dehumidification needs of the zone 
with the greatest demand.

GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR BALANCING AIR SYSTEMS 
 
Prepare test reports for both fans and outlets.  Obtain manufacturer's outlet factors and recommended testing 
procedures.  Crosscheck the summation of required outlet volumes with required fan volumes.  When comparing 
volumes, correct for temperature. 
 
Prepare schematic diagrams of systems' "as-built" duct layouts. 
 
For variable-air-volume systems, develop a plan to simulate diversity. 
 
Determine the best locations in main and branch ducts for accurate duct-airflow measurements. 
 
Locate start-stop and disconnect switches, electrical interlocks, and motor starters. 
 
Verify that motor starters are equipped with properly sized thermal protection. 
 
Check condensate drains for proper connections and function. 
 
Check for proper sealing of air-handling-unit components. 
 
Verify that air duct system is sealed and has been pressure tested as specified in Division 23 Section "Metal 
Ducts." 
 
3.6. 
PROCEDURES FOR CONSTANT-VOLUME AIR SYSTEMS 
 
Adjust fans to deliver total indicated airflows. 
Measure total airflow by Pitot-tube traverse. 
 
Where sufficient space in ducts is unavailable for Pitot-tube traverse measurements, measure airflow at terminal 
outlets and inlets and calculate the total airflow.  Where airflow stations are installed verify accuracy of measured 
values against pitot traverse. 
 
Measure static pressure directly at the fan outlet or through the flexible connection. 
 
Measure inlet static pressure of single-inlet fans in the inlet duct as near the fan as possible, upstream from the 
flexible connection, and downstream from duct restrictions. 
 
Measure inlet static pressure of double-inlet fans through the wall of the plenum that houses the fan. 
 
Measure static pressure across each component that makes up an air-handling unit, rooftop unit, and other air-
 
Report the cleanliness status of filters at the time static pressures are measured. 
Measure static pressures entering and leaving other devices, such as sound traps, heat-recovery equipment, and 
air washers, under final balanced conditions. 
 
Review Documents to determine variations in design static pressures versus actual static pressures.  Recommend 
adjustments to accommodate actual conditions. 
 
Do not make fan-speed adjustments that result in motor overload.  Consult equipment manufacturers about fan-
speed safety factors.  For AHU’s with economizer modulate AHU dampers and measure fan-motor amperage to 
ensure that no overload will occur.  Measure amperage in full-cooling, full-heating, economizer, and any other 
operating mode to determine the maximum required brake horsepower. 
 
Adjust volume dampers for main duct, submain ducts, and major branch ducts to indicated airflows within 
specified tolerances. 
 
Measure airflow of submain ducts by Pitot-tube traverse. 
 
Where sufficient space in submain ducts is unavailable for Pitot-tube traverse measurements, measure airflow at 
terminal outlets and inlets and calculate the total airflow for that zone. 
 
Remeasure each submain and branch duct after all have been adjusted.  Continue to adjust submain and branch 
ducts to indicated airflows within specified tolerances. 
 
Measure air outlets and inlets without making adjustments. 
 
Measure terminal outlets using a direct-reading hood or outlet manufacturer's written instructions and calculating 
factors. 
 
Adjust supply air outlets for each space to indicated airflows within specified tolerances of indicated values.  
Make adjustments using branch volume dampers rather than the dampers at air terminals. 
 
Adjust each supply outlet in same room or space to within specified tolerances of indicated quantities without 
generating noise levels above the limitations prescribed by the Contract Documents. 
 
Adjust patterns of adjustable outlets for proper distribution without drafts. 
 
When all supply outlets are within acceptable tolerance, adjust return/exhaust outlets to achieve the desired room 
pressurization requirements, as described later. 
 
3.7. 
BUILDING ROOM PRESSURIZATION BALANCING 
 
Schedule a time with the owner when all doors can be kept closed. Typically, night or weekend. 
 
Measure airflow direction and relative room pressures in inches wg for existing areas in the project scope.  This 
shall be done by taking pressure readings to show pressurization and airflow direction between adjacent facility 
spaces. 
 
Initially balance the supply airflows and exhaust hoods to the quantities shown on the drawings as described 
above.  Then balance the exhaust and return air outlet flows to obtain the required pressurizations as indicated on 
the drawings.  If return or exhaust outlets do not exist in the space, then readjust the supply air flows to obtain the 
required pressurizations.  Differential pressures are shown on the pressurization plans. 
 
Rebalance and verify the fixed supply or exhaust hood airflows to the quantities shown on the drawings.  
Rebalancing of the exhaust and return airflows (or supply airflows, if only hoods exist for exhaust) shall follow 
 
When the airflow is in the intended direction and the pressures have been obtained, Owner shall witness a final 
balance verification of the air system flow quantities and the pressurizations obtained for spaces within the 
building.  This shall be done by pressure readings to show pressurization and airflow direction between the facility 
spaces.  If complications arise or the pressurization requirements are not obtainable, notify Owner immediately 
and include a probable cause for the airflow problem.  Do not proceed until the problem has been corrected or 
direction from Owner has been obtained. 
 
If automatic control of supply/return airflows to individual rooms or dynamic room pressure control is employed, 
activate control loops one at a time in collaboration with control contractor and verify proper control operation 
and tuning. 
 
3.8. 
GENERAL PROCEDURES FOR HYDRONIC SYSTEMS

position when pump is positive-displacement type unless several terminal valves are kept open. 
 
Set system controls so automatic valves are wide open to heat exchangers and coils. 
 
Check pump-motor load.  If motor is overloaded, throttle main flow-balancing device so motor 
nameplate rating is not exceeded.

Initial Inspection: 
 
After testing and balancing are complete, operate each system and randomly check measurements to 
verify that the system is operating according to the final test and balance readings documented in the 
final report. 
 
Check the following for each system: 
 
Measure airflow of at least 10 percent of air outlets. 
 
Measure water flow of at least five (5) percent of terminals. 
 
Measure room temperature at each thermostat/temperature sensor.  Compare the reading to the 
set point. 
 
Verify that balancing devices are marked with final balance position. 
 
Note deviations from the Contract Documents in the final report. 
 
Measure airflows at or close to flow stations.  Compare readings to BMS indicator. 
 
Final Inspection: 
 
After initial inspection is complete and documentation by random checks verifies that testing and 
balancing are complete and accurately documented in the final report, request that a final inspection be 
made by Engineer. 
 
The TAB contractor's test and balance engineer shall conduct the inspection in the presence of the 
Engineer. 
 
Engineer shall randomly select measurements, documented in the final report, to be rechecked.  
Rechecking shall be limited to the total measurements that can be accomplished in a four (4) hour period.  
All room pressures shall be verified where room pressures are critical. 
 
If rechecks yield measurements that differ from the measurements documented in the final report by 
more than the tolerances allowed, the measurements shall be noted as "FAILED." 
 
If the number of "FAILED" measurements is greater than 10 percent of the total measurements checked 
during the final inspection, the testing and balancing shall be considered incomplete and shall be rejected. 
 
TAB Work will be considered defective if it does not pass final inspections.  If TAB Work fails, proceed as 
follows: 
 
Recheck all measurements and make adjustments.  Revise the final report and balancing device settings 
to include all changes; resubmit the final report and request a second final inspection. 
 
If the second final inspection also fails, Owner may contract the services of another TAB contractor to 
complete TAB Work according to the Contract Documents and deduct the cost of the services from the 
original TAB contractor's final payment. 
 
Prepare test and inspection reports. 
 
3.19. ADDITIONAL TESTS 
 
Within 90 days of completing TAB, perform additional TAB to verify that balanced conditions are being 
maintained throughout and to correct unusual conditions. 
 
Seasonal Periods:  If initial TAB procedures were not performed during near-peak summer and winter conditions, 
perform additional TAB to verify equipment performance during near-peak summer and winter conditions.

Air-Duct Equipment Circuits: Install insulated equipment grounding conductor to duct-mounted electrical devices 
operating at 120 V and more, including air cleaners, heaters, dampers, humidifiers, and other duct electrical 
equipment. Bond conductor to each unit and to air duct and connected metallic piping. 
 
Isolated Equipment Enclosure Circuits: For designated equipment supplied by a branch circuit or feeder, isolate 
equipment enclosure from supply circuit raceway with a nonmetallic raceway fitting listed for the purpose. Install 
fitting where raceway enters enclosure, and install a separate insulated equipment grounding conductor. Isolate 
conductor from raceway and from panelboard grounding terminals. Terminate at equipment grounding conductor 
terminal of the applicable derived system or service unless otherwise indicated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.3. 
INSTALLATION 
 
Grounding Conductors: Route along shortest and straightest paths possible unless otherwise indicated or required 
by Code. Avoid obstructing access or placing conductors where they may be subjected to strain, impact, or 
damage. 
 
Bonding Straps and Jumpers: Install in locations accessible for inspection and maintenance except where routed 
through short lengths of conduit. 
 
1. Bonding to Structure: Bond straps directly to basic structure, taking care not to penetrate any adjacent 
parts. 
2. Bonding to Equipment Mounted on Vibration Isolation Hangers and Supports: Install bonding so 
vibration is not transmitted to rigidly mounted equipment. 
3. Use exothermic-welded connectors for outdoor locations; if a disconnect-type connection is required, 
use a bolted clamp. 
 
Grounding and Bonding for Piping: 
 
1. Metal Water Service Pipe: Install insulated copper grounding conductors, in conduit, from building's 
main service equipment, or grounding bus, to main metal water service entrances to building. Connect 
grounding conductors to main metal water service pipes; use a bolted clamp connector or bolt a lug-type 
connector to a pipe flange by using one of the lug bolts of the flange. Where a dielectric main water 
fitting is installed, connect grounding conductor on street side of fitting. Bond metal grounding conductor 
conduit or sleeve to conductor at each end. 
2. Bond each aboveground portion of gas piping system downstream from equipment shutoff valve. 
 
Grounding for Steel Building Structure: Install a driven ground rod at base of each corner column and at 
intermediate exterior columns at distances not more than 60 feet apart. 
 
3.4. 
FIELD QUALITY CONTROL 
 
Testing Agency: Engage a qualified testing agency to perform tests and inspections. 
 
Tests and Inspections: Refer to maximum resistance values listed below. 
 
1. After installing grounding system but before permanent electrical circuits have been energized, test for 
compliance with requirements. 
2. Inspect physical and mechanical condition. Verify tightness of accessible, bolted, electrical connections 
with a calibrated torque wrench according to manufacturer's written instructions. Resistance of any bond 
connection cannot exceed 0.5 milliohms. 
3. Test completed grounding system at each location where a maximum ground-resistance level is 
specified, at service disconnect enclosure grounding terminal, at ground test wells, and at individual 
ground rods. Perform tests at ground rods before any conductors are energized. 
4. Measure ground resistance no fewer than two full days after last trace of precipitation and without soil 
being moistened by any means other than natural drainage or seepage and without chemical treatment 
or other artificial means of reducing natural ground resistance. 
5. Perform continuity test on all power receptacles to ensure that they ground terminals are properly 
grounded to the facility ground system. 
6. Perform tests by fall-of-potential method according to IEEE 81. 
7. Prepare dimensioned Drawings locating each test well, ground rod and ground-rod assembly, and other 
grounding electrodes. Identify each by letter in alphabetical order, and key to the record of tests and 
observations. Include the number of rods driven and their depth at each location, and include 
observations of weather and other phenomena that may affect test results. Describe measures taken to 
improve test results. 
 
Grounding system will be considered defective if it does not pass tests and inspections. 
 
Prepare test and inspection reports. 
 
Report measured ground resistances that exceed the following values as measured from the farthest point on the 
respective system to true earth ground: 
 
1. Power and lighting equipment or system with capacity of 500 kVA and less: 10 ohms. 
2. Power and lighting equipment or system with capacity of 500 to 1000 kVA: 5 ohms. 
3. Power and lighting equipment or system with capacity more than 1000 kVA: 3 ohms. 
4. Power distribution units or panelboards serving electronic equipment: 3 ohms [1] ohm(s). 
5. Metal Framing (steel) of buildings: 5 ohms 
6. Pad-Mounted Equipment: 5 ohms

Fittings and junction boxes utilized on color systems shall be colored identically to raceway coloring. 
 
 
3.2. 
INSTALLATION 
 
General:  Install electrical raceways in accordance with manufacturer's written installation instructions, applicable 
requirements of NEC, and as follows: 
 
Minimum size for all conduits shall be 3/4" trade size. 
 
NEC type AC, MC, and NM cables are expressly prohibited and shall not be used.  
 
Pull boxes shall be installed in each conduit run every 100’ – 150’; and no greater distance than 150’. 
 
The maximum number of bends in any single run of conduit shall not exceed 360° (4-90°) per NEC. All feeder 
raceways shall not exceed 270° of bends between pull boxes. 
 
Keep raceways at least 6" away from parallel runs of flues and steam or hot water pipes.  Install raceways level 
and square and at proper elevations. 
 
Complete installation of electrical raceways before starting installation of conductors within raceways. 
 
Provide supports for raceways per National Electrical Code.  Conduit shall not be fastened to or supported from 
ductwork, piping, lay-in ceiling support wires, mechanical equipment, or other conduit.  
 
Provide adequate seismic bracing for all raceways as required by the project. 
 
Prevent foreign matter from entering raceways by using temporary closure protection. 
 
Make bends and offsets so the inside diameter is not effectively reduced.  Unless otherwise indicated, keep the 
legs of a bend in the same plane and the straight legs of offsets parallel. 
 
Use raceway fittings that are of types compatible with the associated raceway and suitable for the use and location.   
 
The use of conduit bodies shall be limited where possible. Where necessary to use conduit bodies, use LB fittings 
for conduits up to 2 inches. For fittings on conduits sized larger than 2 inches, mogul units shall be installed. 
 
 
Run concealed raceways with a minimum of bends in the shortest practical distance considering the type of 
building construction and obstructions except as otherwise indicated.  This does not apply to conduits in crawl 
spaces. 
 
Install exposed raceways parallel and perpendicular to nearby surfaces or structural members and follow the 
surface contours as much as practical. 
 
Run exposed, parallel, or banked raceways together.  Make bends in parallel or banked runs from the same 
centerline so that the bends are parallel.  Factory elbows may be used in banked runs only where they can be 
installed parallel.  This requires that there be a change in the plane of the run such as from wall to ceiling and that 
the raceways are of the same size.  In other cases, provide field bends for parallel raceways. 
 
Join raceways with fittings designed and approved for the purpose.  Make raceway terminations tight.  Tighten 
setscrews of threadless fittings with suitable tool. 
 
Where subject to vibration or dampness, use insulating bushings to protect conductors and bonding bushings or 
wedges to assure electrical continuity of the raceway. 
 
Elevation of Raceway:  Where possible, install horizontal raceway runs above water and steam piping. 
 
Raceways Embedded in Slabs:  Install in middle third of the slab thickness where practical and leave at least 1" 
concrete cover.  Tie raceways to reinforcing rods or otherwise secure them to prevent sagging or shifting during 
concrete placement.  To prevent voids in the concrete, space raceways laterally.  Run conduit larger than 1" trade 
size, parallel with or at right angles to the main reinforcement; where at right angles to the reinforcement, the 
conduit shall be close to one of the supports of the slab.  Where nonmetallic conduit or tubing is used, raceways 
must be converted to rigid metal before rising above floor.  
 
Tape all penetrations through vapor barrier to maintain vapor barrier integrity.  Coordinate requirements with 
vapor barrier installer. 
 
Do not install aluminum conduit embedded in or in contact with concrete. 
 
Protect stub-ups from damage where conduits rise from floor slabs.  Arrange so curved portion of bends are not 
visible above the finished slab. 
 
Penetrations through slab using rigid metal requires corrosion protection.  Prepare conduit with Scotchrap Pipe 
Primer and Scotchfill Electrical Insulation Putty or engineering approved equal products.  Provide and apply 
Scotchrap Corrosion Protection Tape 51 or engineering approved equal product to length of conduit through slab 
including below grade elbow to nearest underground coupling or PVC adapter. Installation of corrosion protection 
tape including layers and overlap shall be per manufacture’s recommendations.   
 
Stub-up Connections:  Extend conduits through concrete floor for connection to freestanding equipment with an 
internally threaded coupling for plugs.  Extend conductors to equipment with rigid metal conduit; flexible metal 
conduit may be used 6" above the floor.  Where equipment connections are not made under this contract, install 
screwdriver-operated threaded flush plugs with floor. 
 
Terminations:  Where raceways are terminated with locknuts and bushings, align the raceway to enter squarely 
and install the locknuts with dished part against the box.  Where terminations cannot be made secure with one (1) 
locknut, use two (2) locknuts – one (1) inside and one (1) outside the box. 
 
Where terminating in threaded hubs, screw the raceway or fitting tight into the hub so the end bears against the 
wire protection shoulder.  Where chase nipples are used, align the raceway so the coupling is square to the box, 
and tighten the chase nipple so no threads are exposed. 
 
 
Pull Wires:  Install pull wires in empty raceways.  Use #14 AWG zinc-coated steel or monofilament plastic line 
having not less than 200 lb. tensile strength.  Leave not less than 12" of slack at each end of the pull wire. 
 
Telephone and Signal System Raceways 2" Trade Size and Smaller:  In addition to the above requirements, install 
raceways 2" and smaller trade size in maximum lengths at 150’ and with a maximum of two (2), 90° bends or 
equivalent.  Install pull or junction boxes where necessary to comply with these requirements. 
 
Flexible Connections:  Install separate ground conductor across flexible connections. Conductor shall be on the 
inside or outside of the raceway. Flexible conduits shall not be used as an equipment ground conductor. 
 
Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) Connections:  Install conductors in metal conduit from the output of the VFD 
to the motor.  Power wiring to the motor must have the maximum separation from all other power wiring whether 
from the same drive or other drives. Do not run VFD power wiring in the same conduit with other load or control 
wiring.  Control conductors shall be run in separate metal raceways.  
 
PVC Externally Coated Rigid Metal Conduit:  Use only fittings approved for use with that material.  Use non-
marring tools for the installation to prevent damage to the coating.  Patch all nicks and scrapes in PVC coating 
with a minimum thickness of 0.040” (1mm) after installing conduit. 
 
Surface Metal Raceway:  Install a separate green ground conductor in raceway from the junction box supplying 
the raceway to receptacle or fixture ground terminals. 
 
Select each surface metal raceway outlet box to which a lighting fixture is attached to be of sufficient diameter to 
provide a seat for the fixture canopy. 
 
Where a surface metal raceway is used to supply a lighting fixture having central stem suspension with a back 
plate and a canopy, with or without extension ring, the back plate and canopy will serve as the outlet box and no 
separate outlet box need be provided. 
Provide surface metal raceway outlet box, in addition to the back plate and canopy, at the feed-in location of each 
fluorescent lighting fixture having end stem suspension. 
 
Where a surface metal raceway extension is made from an existing outlet box on which a lighting fixture is 
installed, provide a back plate slightly smaller than the fixture canopy, and no additional surface mounted outlet 
box need be installed. 
 
Exterior (Roof and Above Grade):  Where raceways are installed above a rooftop or are exposed to sunlight, 
raceways shall be installed a minimum of 7/8” above the roof to the bottom of the raceway (except where XHHW-
2 conductors are utilized.) 
 
3.3. 
ADJUSTING AND CLEANING 
 
Upon completion of installation of raceways, inspect interiors of raceways; clear all blockages and remove burrs, 
dirt, and construction debris.

FOUNDATION FIELDBUS COMPONENTS  
 
All assembled components shall be rated NEMA 4 and IEC IP67 that are not in enclosures.  This includes 
Cordsets, Connectors, Glands, Couplers, Terminators, Bricks, and Tees.  Foundation Fieldbus segments will use 
components manufactured by Turck or Stonel unless indicated otherwise on design documents, this specification 
or approved by Owner/Engineer. 
 
Allowable Devices: 
 
Only devices rated for Foundation Fieldbus shall be allowed to be connected to a Foundation Fieldbus network.   
The maximum number of devices allowable on a fieldbus segment depends on the type of devices. 
 
DEVICE TYPE 
MAXIMUM DEVICES PER SEGMENT 
Bus Powered and Intrinsically Safe (110mA max) 
5 
Bus / Non-Bus Powered and Non-Intrinsically safe 
16 
 
The maximum number of field devices per segment is 16. Per design constrains, no more than 4 of these devices 
may be control valves. 
 
All control valves and any associated analytical devices used for valve control must be connected to the same 
segment. 
 
Distance Limitations:   
 
Maximum available segment length is limited to 1,900 M (1.18 miles).  This is the summation of the trunk line 
and all spurs.  Individual spurs can measure from 1M (3.28ft.) to 120M (394ft.) depending on the number of 
devices on the segment. 
 
Foundation Fieldbus and cables are shielded to minimize noise due to inductive coupling.  Installation of cables 
shall maintain suitable separation from cables and equipment emitting noise.  Cables shall be physically separated 
from power cables, transformers, variable frequency drives and drive cables, rotating equipment, and other high-
power machinery.  The minimum separation distance between signal cables and power lines shall be as follows: 
 
 
VOLTAGE 
CURRENT 
MINIMUM SEPARATION 
DISTANCE (INCHES) 
0 – 125 VOLTS 
0 – 10 A 
12 INCHES 
125 – 250 VOLTS 
1 – 50 A 
15 INCHES 
250 – 440 VOLTS 
0 – 200 A 
18 INCHES 
 
Signal wiring and AC power cable separated by the recommended distances should not run parallel for more than 
20 ft.  If longer parallel runs are needed, increase the separation distance by 12 inches for each additional 30 ft in 
length. 
 
Signal cable shall be separated from devices that generate magnetic fields (motors, variable frequency drives, 
power cables, etc.) by a minimum of five (5) feet; ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet separation is recommended. 
 
2.1.1. 
Cables 
 
Cables shall be specific to the fieldbus type selected and conform to related standards regarding cable types, 
routing, and distance.   Bulk cable for Foundation Fieldbus shall be Belden 3076F or approved equivalent. 
 
 
For services installed above fire protection use black-jacketed plenum cable containing 2/20 AWG White 
TC/White BC data conductors with an overall braid and foil shield.  (Belden 89207) Cable shall meet ISA-SP50 
Standard for Type B and shall be UL-910 and CMP rated. 
 
Receptacles and Glands 
 
All male gland receptacles specified come with external threaded connections.  Male gland receptacles shall be 
installed in all Foundation Fieldbus field instruments such as transmitters and valve positioners.  In general, they 
shall be factory installed.  However, these may also be field installed by the I&C Contractor or Skid Vendor if 
not supplied with the instrument.    Glands shall be installed in a ½ inch – 14 NPT conduit connections.    
 
The use of female gland receptacles for instrument connections shall be prohibited. 
 
Terminators 
 
Termination of the Foundation Fieldbus Cable in the field requires a 100 ΩRC network-terminating resistor with 
a male Minifast connector.  Two terminators are required for each segment and are to be located at the beginning 
and end of the segment trunk line.  The I&C Sub-Contractor or Equipment/Skid Vendor will provide the 
terminator at the end of each field segment as indicated on the project drawings.    
 
Termination of the Foundation Fieldbus Cable in the DCS control cabinet shall be through the built-in terminating 
resistor of the fieldbus power supply.  The unit shall be approved for IEC 61158-2 and ISA-SP50.2 installations. 
 
Multi-port Junctions 
 
Multi-Port Junctions shall be the primary connection for Foundation Fieldbus devices.  Multi-port shall have a 
female Minifast spur connector and a Grounding Lug.  The brick shall provide short circuit protection on each 
spur connection. 
 
The use of DIN-rail mount junctions, for installation within instrument panels shall be allowed, subject to approval 
by the Owner/Engineer. 
 
Power Supplies 
 
Foundation Fieldbus are powered bus networks requiring a power supply for the devices on the segment and to 
carry the Manchester Encoded Signal.  The power supply shall be rated at least 420mA at 24 VDC and have a 
built-in terminating resistor.  The power supply shall have a FM approval rating for Class 1, Div 2, in an 
appropriate enclosure and be approved for IEC 61158-2 and ISA-SP50.02 installations.  Redundant power 
supplies shall meet IEC/ISA physical layer standards.  Paralleling two power supplies to obtain redundancy shall 
not be permitted if stated standards are not adhered to.   Power supplies shall provide diagnostic capability unless 
specifically approved otherwise by the Owner. 
 
Polarity 
 
Foundation Fieldbus signals are polarized.  Connecting the fieldbus cables with reverse polarity will cause the 
device to not communicate properly with the fieldbus interface module.  Fieldbus signals shall be connected so 
they all see the proper polarity.  
 
Voltage Drop 
 
Voltage drop shall be considered when installing a fieldbus network.  Refer to project documents for estimated 
distances and voltage available at each fieldbus device.  Verify trunk and spur lengths prior to installation and 
adjust cable route accordingly.  Minimum voltage allowable at the terminals of a fieldbus device is nine (9) VDC. 
If device locations cannot meet voltage requirements, notify owner or owners representative immediately. 
 
Repeaters 
 
None required.  Distance limitations shall be adhered to. 
 
Intrinsic Safety 
 
Fieldbus segments used in a potentially flammable atmosphere shall meet the applicable requirements of the 
National Electric Code.  Refer to project drawings for definition of electrical area classification.  Special fieldbus 
barriers and terminators are required for intrinsically safe installations.  Separation and identification requirements 
for IS wiring shall be adhered to. 
 
Connection to High-Speed Networks 
 
31.25kbit/s fieldbus networks cannot be directly connected to a higher speed fieldbus network.  When connecting 
to a higher speed network, a special bridge or linking device must be used.  The bridge will be counted as one of 
the 32 field devices on the network. 
 
2.2.

Tees 
 
T-ports are the primary way to establish a drop from the trunk line.  Tees should be the sealed type that are keyed 
and connect via mini style quick connectors.  However, if project drawings call for an open style, they are 
permitted.  
 
 
 
Multi-Port Taps 
 
Multi-Port Taps or Bricks shall be the primary connection for DeviceNet devices.  Bricks shall have a female 
quick connect spur connectors and a Grounding Lug.  The brick shall provide short circuit protection on each 
device connection.  Multi-port taps come in two, four, or eight device ports.   
 
Terminators 
 
Termination of the DeviceNet trunk in the field shall be a resistor that is sealed into a T-port tap when round cable 
is used.  If flat cable is used, the terminating resistor shall be a snap-on cap for the flat cable connector base and 
be sealed.  The terminating resistor shall be UL and FM certified. 
 
Power Supplies 
 
DeviceNet devices require a 24 VDC power supply for the devices to operate.    The power supply shall have a 
UL approval rating of UL-508.  Power supplies shall have current limiting protection per NEC Article 725.  Power 
supplies shall comply with the Open DeviceNet Vendor Association (ODVA) power supply specifications and

plastic tubing shall not be run near high temperature sources such as uninsulated steam pipe. 
 
Install all plastic tubing with sufficient slack in each straight run to assure that subsequent shrinkage will not 
cause the tubing to shrink into a state of stress.  It is strongly recommended that plastic tubing not be terminated 
the same day it is installed into the raceway in order to avoid this.  
 
Fittings shall not be installed near a tubing bend.  A length of straight tube, not deformed by bending, shall be 
required.  When a tubing section that contains a bend is being connected, the end section shall be in proper 
alignment with the fitting.  Springing the tube into position with the fitting shall not be permitted, as it may result 
in excessive stress and possible leakage. 
 
Instrument piping and tubing shall be as short as practicable between the source connection and the instrument 
location with the minimum number of fittings in order to minimize the potential for leakage. 
 
Wrap all tapered pipe threads with Teflon tape to prevent thread galling upon disconnection.  Do not allow the 
tape to extend past the last thread on the connection end.  
 
All tubing shall be installed in continuous length from: 
 
1. The instrument to the instrument air supply valve 
2. The instrument to a pneumatic junction box fitting or bulk head fitting 
3. The instrument to another instrument 
 
Make tubing unions in raceways, sheets, or groupings in junction boxes.  
 
Provide inserts on 3/8” OD and larger plastic tubing.  
 
3.5. 
TESTING 
 
Test pneumatic tubing system installations in accordance with ISA Standard ISA-7.0.01 “Quality Standard for 
Instrument Air”, Annex C.   
 
Records of all tests shall be maintained by the installer and shall be submitted to the Owner. The Owner may 
witness any tests. 
 
The instrument at the outlet end of the tubing under test shall remain connected whenever possible.  Allowance 
in the duration of the test shall be made to compensate for the additional volume in the instrument.  
 
Reconnect all instruments to the tubing system after successfully completing the test. Check the re-connections 
with a bubble test.  Apply a soap solution to the joint under test.  The joint is not properly sealed if bubbles form 
around the joint.  Reseal and recheck until the joint passes.

INSTRUMENT CALIBRATION AND COMMISSIONING 
 
 
INDEX 
PAGE 
 
PART 1. - GENERAL 
 
Extent of the controls and instrumentation work is indicated on drawings and schedules and by requirements of 
this section.  This section covers the calibration and commissioning of the electronic and pneumatic 
instrumentation and controls. 
 
The Work under this section is subject to requirements of Sections 409010, 409050, 409100 and requirements of 
the Contract Documents including the general documents, supplementary conditions, and sections under Division 
01 General Requirements. 
 
Any deviations from the equipment components described in this section must be pre-approved by the Owner or 
Owner's Representative prior to purchase. 
 
1.1. 
GENERAL 
 
Calibrate all instruments furnished or installed under Section 409100 which have functions that can be confirmed 
to operate correctly by testing. 
 
All functions of all instruments shall be tested for full and correct operation.  
 
 
PART 2. - PRODUCTS 
 
2.1. 
CALIBRATION EQUIPMENT 
 
All calibration equipment shall be current, up-to-date models, of industrial instrumentation quality, and 
manufactured by a company regularly engaged in the production of industrial instrumentation calibration 
equipment.  
 
All calibration equipment shall have a readout resolution and accuracy that meets or exceeds (one order greater 
where possible) that of the instrument to be calibrated.  
 
All calibration equipment shall have a current verification of calibration certificate traceable to the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology.  A copy of this document shall be furnished to the Owner before this 
equipment is used for calibration and for all subsequent verification of calibration.  This documentation shall 
include an error report of the calibration.  
 
The error report of the calibration equipment shall be to an accuracy that meets or exceeds (one order greater 
where possible) the accuracy of the calibration equipment.  
 
 
PART 3. - EXECUTION 
 
3.1. 
GENERAL 
 
Instruments shall be calibrated before the required time of installation.  Instruments that have long lead times for 
delivery shall be calibrated in time to obtain and calibrate a replacement if necessary before the instrument is 
required for installation.  Instruments that have a replacement lead time greater than the time left before 
installation shall be calibrated as soon as possible.  The Owner shall be informed immediately of instruments in 
this category with which problems are encountered.  
 
All instruments shall be calibrated to within the manufacturer's stated accuracy.  
 
All components of an assembly shall be calibrated individually and then the assembly calibrated.  
 
On electronic instruments, simply using the internal simulation of the process output is not considered an 
acceptable calibration method. 
 
All flow and pressure measuring instruments shall be calibrated to indicate zero flow or pressure at the zero flow 
or pressure input value and to within the manufacturer's stated accuracy at the remaining points. 
 
All flow instruments designated key or critical will require comparative flowing with the use of a flow cart and 
traceable transfer flow device.   
 
The Contractor shall inform the Owner of all instruments requiring excessive calibration or which cannot be 
calibrated to within the specified accuracy limits.  The Owner will take appropriate action as required. 
 
3.2. 
CALIBRATION RECORDS 
 
Record all calibrations, checks, and tests made onto calibration sheets as the calibration is being performed.  The 
first calibration of the instrument shall be marked calibration number 1 (one) and subsequent re-calibrations shall 
be numbered sequentially.  
 
One of three (3) types of calibration sheets shall be used:  
 
Analog Instrument. 
Discrete Instrument (On/Off). 
Orifice Inspection. 
 
Some instruments will require more than one calibration sheet.  A modulating valve with a transducer, a 
positioner, and a position switch, for example, will require four (4) sheets; one each of analog calibration sheets 
for the transducer, the positioner, and the actuator; and one discrete calibration sheet for the position switch.  
When more than one calibration sheet is used, enter the sheet number as part of the total.  The entry for component 
tested shall show which component part is recorded on each sheet.  
 
All calibrations shall be recorded on a separate calibration sheet for each instrument or loop.  
All entries on calibration sheets shall be handwritten into the correct location for these entries and shall be made 
using blue water-proof ink by the person performing the calibration.  
 
Date of calibration shall be recorded on each calibration sheet for each instrument on the date the calibration is 
performed.  
 
Calibration sheets shall have all entries completed, except where noted otherwise on the calibration sheet.  The 
entry "N/A" can only be used for those entries that are non-applicable.  Any applicable test that was not performed 
shall have a notation entered that clearly indicates the test was not made.  The entry "N/P" will not be accepted.  
Not performing an applicable test must have Owner approval and the reason for not performing the test shall be 
recorded in the remarks section of the calibration sheet.  
 
The actual values of all data shall be entered.  Entries of "OK", a check mark, or similar is unacceptable.  
 
Manufacturer name, model, and serial number of the calibration equipment used for the calibration shall be 
recorded on the calibration sheet for each instrument. 
 
The calibration date of the calibration equipment and the calibration certificate number for the calibration 
equipment shall be recorded on the calibration sheet for each instrument.  
 
The name of the person performing the calibration and the date shall be recorded on the bottom of each calibration 
sheet.  
 
Instruments that are re-calibrated shall require a new calibration sheet, in which, after completed, shall be 
permanently filed with prior sheets and other associated design, installation, and maintenance records.  Copies of 
the calibration sheets shall be submitted to the Owner daily for inspection, with the originals collated for 
submission to the Owner immediately following project completion.  Calibration sheets and all other associated 
records pertaining to a particular instrument and subject to Owner-specified retention periods shall be made 
available to the Owner for maintenance.   
 
Each instrument shall have a small, pressure-sensitive adhesive sticker affixed when calibrated.  This shall have 
the date of calibration and the Calibrator's initials written on it in black, waterproof ink.  This sticker shall be 
placed upon an internal structure of the instrument where it shall be visible with the cover removed.  It shall not 
be placed on the cover exterior or interior.  Reasonable judgment shall be used for instruments for which this is 
impractical, e.g.; liquid filled pressure gauges, and items of like nature. 
 
Interlock relays, hand switches, pilot lights, and like items do not require formal calibration and shall be tested 
during check- out.  
 
3.3. 
CALIBRATION EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE 
 
All calibration equipment shall be maintained under the supervision of qualified personnel to prevent 
compromising the integrity of the equipment.  
 
Equipment Abuse: The following actions shall constitute abuse of the calibration equipment: 
1. Equipment storage in a space that does not meet the storage environment specifications of the 
manufacturer; 
2. Failure to acclimate equipment to an environment meeting the specifications of the manufacturer 
before use and used in these conditions; 
3. Failure to ship calibration equipment properly.  Equipment shall be shipped crated, marked 
'Scientific Instrument', and shipped with special handling service via a commercial courier, e.g.; 
Purolator, Federal Express, United Parcel Service. 
4. Transporting un-crated calibration equipment in the trunk of an automobile or in the bed of a truck. 
 
Any calibration equipment which has been tampered with, over-ranged, or abused shall have all damage repaired 
and shall have its calibration re-certified before being used again. 
 
3.4. 
GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURES FOR ANALOG INSTRUMENTS 
 
All analog instruments (to include modulating valves) shall be given a three-point calibration check of the 
 
instrument after calibration (as left).  This shall be accomplished by applying an input signal equivalent to 0, 50 
and 100 percent of the input range of the instrument.  This check shall be made with both an increasing signal 
from below zero percent to one hundred percent and a decreasing signal from above one hundred percent to zero 
percent with no overshoot or back up. The percentage test points may be changed in cases where it is more 
reasonable to do so; i.e.; it may be more practical to test a square root extraction module at other points to obtain 
a more meaningful test.  
 
The calibration may be made at less than three points for instruments that are not normally checked at this many 
points.  This includes pressure gauges and thermometers.  Other instruments, such as pH meters, conductivity 
meters, vapor fractionating analyzers, infra-red absorption analyzers, and the like are normally calibrated using a 
set of known samples. 
  
All analog instruments with digital communication shall be read and recorded at the first (nearest to the sending 
device) accessible point of raw data.  The data register should not be scaled or in engineering units but merely an 
A/D conversion of the proportional magnitude respective to the device’s range and bit resolution.  Scaling and 
engineering units of same are checked (verified or validated) elsewhere.  
 
3.5. 
GENERAL CALIBRATION PROCEDURES FOR DISCRETE INSTRUMENTS 
 
All discrete instruments, pressure switches, temperature switches, on/off valves, position switches, flow switches, 
and like items, shall be tested at the operation point for proper functioning and adjusted as required.  Adjustments 
made shall be recorded on the calibration sheet.  The actual operating point shall be recorded on the calibration 
sheet.  
 
This check shall be made with an increasing signal from below the trip point until the point of actuation for high 
condition switches and with a decreasing signal from above the trip point until the point of actuation for low 
condition switches.  
 
3.6. 
SPECIFIC CALIBRATION REQUIREMENTS 
 
Mass Flow Instruments: These shall be calibrated by the manufacturer.  An appropriate calibration certificate with 
full details of the calibration including as-found and as-left conditions these shall be obtained from the 
manufacturer for each element/transmitter.  Requirements of manufacturer’s calibration shall be no less stringent 
than this specification. 
 
TOC/Conductivity analyzers: These shall be calibrated by the manufacturer.  An appropriate calibration 
certificate with full details of the calibration including as-found and as-left conditions shall be obtained from the 
manufacturer for each element/transmitter.  Requirements of manufacturer’s calibration shall be no less stringent 
than this specification. 
 
Level Instruments: Level probe type instruments using capacitance, conductivity, or RF shall be calibrated in 
accordance with the manufacturer's procedure.  Float or displacer type instruments shall be calibrated by one of 
the following methods: 1) By using calibration weights to shop calibrate and confirm in service, 2) By using a 
well to hold liquid of a known height and of a specific gravity which matches the process.  
 
Pressure and Differential Pressure Instruments: Calibrate using a pressure source.  Pressure instruments with 
remote seals shall be calibrated using a flange jig fitted to the diaphragm face.  The calibration of instruments 
with remote seals shall correctly simulate the different field elevations of the installed transmitter and seal.  The 
calibration of pressure instruments connected with filled impulse lines shall correctly simulate the effect of the 
fill fluid.  
 
Resistance Temperature Detectors (RTD) These shall be checked with an ohmmeter for continuity, and, for 
ungrounded RTDs, shorts to the sheath.  RTDs shall be checked using a temperature bath, or baths, capable of 
temperature variations as required by the span of the instrument.    
 
Analog Temperature Transmitters having RTD inputs shall be calibrated first using a decade box, and then finally 
using the actual temperature element that will be used with the transmitter in the aforementioned temperature 
bath(s).  
 
Discrete Temperature Instruments shall be checked using a temperature bath, or baths, capable of temperature 
variations as required by the span of the instrument.  
 
Valves: All valves shall be leak-tested in the closed position and shall meet the specified leak rating.  It is 
recommended this check be made initially.  Valves, modulating and on/off, shall be fully closed with an input 
signal corresponding to fully closed.  Valves, modulating and on/off, which are fail closed shall be fully closed 
with the design conditions for full closed in effect.  
 
Modulating Valves: These valves shall be calibrated to obtain a fully closed valve prior to the signal reaching the 
closed valve value of the signal to ensure the valve closes with the control signal.  This shall be between one (1) 
percent and two (2) percent for air-to-open and between 98 percent and 99 percent for air-to-close.  Check the 
actuator and trim for the amount of hysteresis.  Actuators with properly adjusted stem packing are expected to 
have less than 0.2-PSI hysteresis.  Inform the Owner of valves with sticky actuators.  Actuator and trim shall be 
checked for full travel as specified by the manufacturer.  Set the travel indicator to indicate closed at the fully 
closed position.  Set the actuator to the manufacturer's stated bench setting as a separate calibration from the 
positioner calibration.  Calibrate the positioner to obtain full travel proportional to the positioner input signal.  
Calibrate the transducer.  Calibrate the assembly to obtain a fully closed valve at the required signal for fully 
closed.  
 
On/off valves: Check the valve for correctly installed pneumatic connections and solenoid valves.  Check the 
valve for proper direction of operation and fail position.  Check the valve for full travel.  Check that the valve 
closes fully.  Set the speed controls to Owner's requirements.  
 
Valve Position Switches: These switches, on modulating and on/off valves, shall be checked using a slowly 
changing input signal to approach and reach the point of switch actuation.  On/off valves will require a restriction 
in the air line to do this.  This will allow checking that an on/off valve position switch does not indicate closed 
should the valve stick open a small amount.  Valves, with the exception of manual valves with position switches, 
shall not be manually operated to accomplish this calibration.  Valves shall have all other components of the 
assembly calibrated before the position switches are calibrated.  
 
The Analog signal being brought to the modulating valve shall be the signal used to position the valve for 
calibration of the position switches.  The value of this signal shall be the value entered onto the Calibration Sheet 
for the switch.  The pneumatic signal to the valve shall be used for those valves having remote transducers, i.e.; 
the transducer is not mounted directly onto the valve assembly.  
 
The position of on/off valves upon switch actuation shall be the entry entered for these and shall be the Calibrator's 
visual interpretation of the position of the trim.  Fully-closed, fully-opened, and not-closed position switches on 
valves shall be calibrated to actuate as close to the valve mechanical stop as is practical.  
 
Small gauges on valve positioners and air-set regulators require no testing.  These shall be replaced if considered 
defective.  
 
pH Analytical Systems: Remove the probe and insert into buffer solutions having pH levels of the process at the 
process extremes and the process midpoint.  
 
Other Ion Specific Analytical Systems: Remove the probe and insert into a container of fluid having similar 
characteristics as the process fluid.  Check for proper analyzer operation.  Remove the probe and recheck zero.  
 
Electrical Power Measuring Instruments: Watt transmitters shall be shop calibrated and confirmed in operation.  
Shop calibrate current transmitters to the anticipated current flow from the current transformer.  Confirm this 
 
Orifice Plates: Concentric, square-edged, beveled-relief; record the results of this check on the orifice inspection 
sheet.  These shall be checked for conformity to the specifications for pipe size, ANSI rating, material, bore size, 
bore configuration, specified vent/drain, and correct upstream side tang stamping of plates with tangs.  The orifice 
plate shall be inspected for bowing and warping.  The orifice plate shall be flat to within 0.02 (two hundredths) 
inch per inch of the inside diameter of pipe size and schedule into which the orifice plate will be installed.  The 
dam bore shall be inspected for correct configuration: The straight bore of the dam shall not be more than 1/50 
(one fiftieth) of the dam height.  The bevel shall not be less than 45 degrees measured from the piping centerline.  
The orifice plate shall be inspected for nicks and scratches.  There shall be none on the upstream or on the 
downstream face.  The upstream edge of the dam shall be inspected for burrs and sharpness.  There shall be no 
burrs or ridging on this edge and there shall be no reflected light from this edge when viewed from any angle with 
normal vision in a shaded north light.  Orifice plates, integral orifices, flow nozzles, and head-producers other 
than concentric, square-edged, beveled-relief orifice plates shall be inspected for conformity with the 
specifications and the manufacturer's information.  Record the results of this check on the orifice inspection sheet.  
 
Items Which the Owner May Approve for Minimal Calibration and Records: Thermometers and pressure gauges 
shall be checked at a point near the operating point, unless the Owner has agreed to accept the vendor's calibration 
check.  These shall have a pressure adhesive sticker applied showing the date of test and the Calibrator's initials.  
With Owner approval, the vendor's sticker, if present, shall suffice on these items.  
 
Sight glasses, level gauges, and like items need no testing or checking other than the receiving check that these 
items are actually as specified.  No sticker is required, unless the instrumentation Contractor wishes to do such 
for his own record purposes.  
 
Small gauges on valve positioners and air-set regulators require no testing.  These shall be replaced if considered 
defective.

datasheet. 
 
 
 
2.7. 
HOUSING ACCESSORIES 
 
 
 
Refer to the referenced data sheet(s) for the specific accessories required for each filter housing as indicated in 
 
the Table of Contents.  Specifications for each accessory type that will be supplied by the housing Manufacturer 
 
are described below.   
 
 
 
2.7.1. Spray Device 
 
 
 
Filter housings with an 8” internal diameter and larger shall be provided with spray devices.  For diameters less 
 
than 8” the Manufacturer shall determine if spray devices are required to ensure full cleaning of the housing 
 
 
 
All spray devices shall be constructed of the same material, and finished (internally and externally) to the same 
 
polish specification as for the internal, wetted areas of the housing to which the device is intended.  They shall 
 
mount to the housing and to CIP supply and process lines using sanitary tri-clamp type connections.  The housing 
 
Manufacturer shall be responsible for the complete coverage of the wetted internals of the housing for which the 
 
spray device(s) will service.  If more flow, pressure, or spray devices will be required, as determined by the 
 
housing Manufacturer, in order to meet the wetting requirements above, as well as pass the FAT spray tests 
 
indicated elsewhere in this specification, then the Manufacturer shall notify the Owner and Engineer in writing 
 
of the proposed changes.  The changes will be reviewed, and approval shall be required prior to making changes 
 
to the specified design as indicated in the data sheet(s). 
 
 
 
In addition, the hole pattern on the spray device(s) shall be such that all nozzles exposed to the inside of the 
 
housing are completely wetted.  The spray balls shall be welded to the upstream supply tubing, and the entire ball 
 
and tube assembly shall be removable from the housing through the nozzle in which it will be mounted.  All spray 
 
balls shall have a drain hole at their low points when the balls are installed in their operational orientation.  Two 
 
 
 
holes shall also be drilled 180° apart on the supply tube for each spray ball at a location that is inside the housing 
 
nozzle in which it will be inserted, to enhance the cleaning of these nozzles.  Once the position of each spray ball 
 
is determined and drill patterns have been set, they shall be configured with an external locating pin that shall be 
 
mated with a locating bracket and hole that will prevent the spray ball from being installed in any other position.   
 
 
 
Each spray ball assembly shall be permanently marked with the equipment tag number of the housing to which it

EXECUTION 
 
 
 
3.1. 
FACTORY ACCEPTANCE TESTING (FAT) 
 
 
 
The following shall be done when an FAT is part of the purchase agreement. The Manufacturer shall assist Factory 
 
Acceptance Testing (FAT) as it is defined and indicated below.  FAT is in addition to the ASME pressure tests 
 
 
 
and other tests as required by code. The Manufacturer shall submit the schedule for FAT to the Owner and 
 
Engineer.  FAT shall be conducted at the Manufacturer's facility with the Owner or Owner's representative 
 
present, who shall be notified at least two weeks prior to the anticipated test date.   
 
 
 
The Manufacturer shall perform Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) as it is defined and specified in Section 
 
110010 Equipment General Requirements.  See attached specifications for additional FAT requirements.  The 
 
following items shall be the required tests to be performed at the FAT. 
 
 
 
General Verifications: 
 
 
 
• 
Verify the filter housing adherence to specifications, datasheets and project documentation. 
 
• 
Verify compliance with approval drawings, including P&IDs. 
 
• 
Verify the system dimensions – footprint, height, and nozzle arrangement. 
 
• 
Review of turnover package for accuracy and completeness. 
 
• 
Verify the calibration reports for instruments used during FAT. 
 
 
 
Spray Device Coverage:  If spray devices are required in the data sheets, then a spray device coverage test shall 
 
be performed. The Manufacturer shall provide a surge vessel, hoses and circulating pump capable of the required 
 
flow rate and pressure (not to exceed housing pressure) for the proper operation of the spray device(s) of each 
 
housing to be tested.  All wetted components of the test equipment shall be either stainless steel or plastic, and 
 
shall leave no residue other than the test indicator solution on the housing(s) to be tested.  This test shall be for 
 
the purpose of evaluating the spray device(s) for coverage and shadowing.  The test indicator solution shall be an 
 
aqueous riboflavin solution at a nominal concentration of 100 ppm of Eastman Kodak #EK117712 Reagent Grade 
 
Riboflavin Orange powder (1 gram of powder per 10 liters of water) or approved equivalent. 
 
 
 
All internal, wetted accessories that are indicated on each housing data sheet shall be installed on that housing as 
 
part of the spray coverage testing of that housing.  The test indicator solution shall be applied to all the interior 
 
surfaces of the housing (including the inside of all nozzles and their associated caps) by some method other than 
 
using the actual spray devices and the test equipment (e.g., a spray bottle and/or by filling the housing completely 
 
with the test indicator solution, then draining it completely).   
 
 
 
The test indicator solution shall be allowed to completely drain from the housing, and the interior of the housing, 
 
including internal accessories, shall be inspected for complete coverage with the test indicator solution prior to 
 
beginning the spray coverage testing.  The inspection shall be conducted with a UV "black" light, and more test 
 
indicator solution shall be re-applied to any areas that are not covered. Test water flow shall be initiated at the 
 
flow rate and pressure required for the correct operation of the spray device(s), and shall flow for 30 seconds with 
 
the bottom outlet of the housing wide open to drain (no re-circulation back to the surge housing).   
 
 
 
The initiation of flow shall mark the beginning of the spray coverage test.  After the test has ended, allow the 
 
housing to drain. The interior of the housing, including accessories, shall be completely inspected with a UV light 
 
to determine if any residual test indicator solution remains after the test.  If any residual test indicator solution is 
 
detected, another 30 second rinse burst shall be applied, and the interior of the housing re-inspected.  If any 
 
residual test indicator solution is detected, the spray device(s) shall be adjusted and/or modified (e.g., more or 
 
larger holes in spray balls, re-positioning of spray device(s), increased flow rate and/or pressure), and the entire 
 
test repeated, including a fresh application of test indicator solution.   
 
 
 
Once a satisfactory test has been completed (no residual test indicator solution detected), it shall be repeated to 
 
verify the successful results.  The test will be considered successful only when two successful test runs have been 
 
completed in series.  The Manufacturer shall document each and every test, and shall include the time and date 
 
of each test, rinse (spray) time, modifications made (if any), and the areas that failed the visual inspection (if any) 
 
in every test. 
 
 
 
 
 
Drainability Testing:  Water shall be introduced and allowed to pool in the housing base with the bottom port 
 
capped.  The bottom port cap shall then be removed and the liquid allowed to drain into a catch container.  No 
 
liquid shall remain pooled at any location in the housing base. 
 
 
 
Surface Finish Testing:  The Manufacturer shall make available an averaging profilometer along with a sample 
 
that can be agreed to be “acceptable” (retain duplicate of original sample submitted; i.e., original sample to be 
 
provided to Owner for record keeping purposes) for establishing accuracy.  Each housing shall be visually 
 
inspected in its entirety with areas of concern noted with tape flags or Post-it notes.  These points shall then be 
 
inspected using the following procedure: 
 
 
 
• 
The area to be inspected shall be cleaned using acetone and a clean, lint free rag. 
 
• 
The surface area being checked shall be recorded. 
 
• 
Readings shall be taken in three directions, two of which shall be 90° apart. 
 
• 
All readings shall be recorded. 
 
 
 
A minimum of four and a maximum of six points shall be checked on the interior of each housing with the top 
 
and bottom head each being checked.  The exterior of the housing shall also be inspected in this manner with a 
 
maximum of five points measured.  Failure of two or more points may require additional testing.  The 
 
Manufacturer shall provide access to all surfaces.  The housing(s) will be evaluated to determine compliance with 
 
the specifications.  The Manufacturer shall rework any areas not meeting the specification.

tube length shall be determined during shop drawing review. J-tubes shall direct flow to the sidewall of the vessel 
using a no-foam design and shall have a locator pin to ensure proper orientation when installed.  
 
2.9.5. 
Bottom Outlet Valves 
 
Bottom outlet valves shall be of the flush-mounted welded body radial diaphragm type. The body shall be a two 
piece design held together with a sanitary clamp connection. The vessel side of the valve body shall be 
continuously welded to the low point of the bottom head of the vessel. Material shall not be added to the bottom 
head of the vessel to create a “well” in which to weld the valve. If the vessel is insulated, the insulation and 
sheathing shall be cut back to allow for the un-hindered connection of process piping and/or integral satellite 
valve and actuator if designated on data sheet. The valve(s) shall be supplied with the type and style of actuator 
indicated on the data sheet. 
 
 
Valves shall have the same surface finish as the adjacent surfaces, including electropolish as required. The vessel 
Manufacturer shall weld the valve bodies to the vessel, polish the weld seams to meet the requirement of the 
vessels, and then, if indicated on the corresponding data sheet, electropolish the vessel and valve together to meet 
the vessel’s surface specification.

Hydrostatic Pressure Test 
 
Hydrotest water shall be DI water or owner-approved purified water. The hydrotest will be performed at rated 
pressures for the vessel. 
 
3.2.4. 
Spray Device Coverage Test – Top Head 
 
Vessel top heads shall be tested, with all appurtenances installed, separate from and prior to attachment to the 
shell, in order to facilitate the inspection process. The head shall be retested as part of the overall vessel test after 
it has been attached to the shell.  This test shall evaluate the spray devices for coverage and shadowing.  
 
The test indicator solution shall be an aqueous riboflavin solution at a nominal concentration of 100 ppm. The 
test indicator solution shall be applied to all the interior surfaces of the top head by some method other than using 
the actual spray devices and the test equipment. The vessel shall be inspected with a UV "black" light for complete 
coverage of the test indicator solution. More test indicator solution shall be re-applied to any areas that are not 
covered. 
 
Water flow shall be initiated at the flow rate and pressure required of the spray devices, as indicated on the 
approved shop drawings. Water shall flow for 30 seconds for static spray devices or one complete cycle for 
rotating devices, with the bottom outlet of the vessel open to drain. The 30-second bursts shall be repeated 3 times 
per static spray device, or two complete cycles for rotating devices.  
 
After the test has ended, allow top head to drain. The interior of the top head, including accessories, shall be 
completely inspected with a UV light to determine if ANY residual riboflavin remains after the test. If any residual 
riboflavin is detected, the spray devices shall be adjusted and/or modified, and the entire test repeated, including 
a fresh application of riboflavin. Once a satisfactory test has been completed, it shall be repeated to verify the 
successful results. The test shall be considered successful only when two successful test runs have been completed 
in series.  
 
The Manufacturer shall document each and every test and shall include the time and date of each test, spray 
duration, number of sprays, modifications made, flowrate and pressure, and the areas that failed the visual 
inspection, in every test. 
 
3.2.5. 
Spray Device Coverage Test – Fully Assembled Vessel 
 
The Manufacturer shall provide a surge vessel, hoses, and circulating pump capable of the required flow rate and 
pressure (not to exceed vessel Maximum Allowable Working Pressure, MAWP) for the proper operation of the 
spray devices of each vessel to be tested. The test shall include flow rate ranges to meet the minimum and 
maximum pressures required to ensure proper spray coverage. All wetted components of the test equipment shall 
be either stainless steel or plastic and shall leave no residue other than the test indicator solution on the vessel to 
be tested. The test indicator solution shall be an aqueous riboflavin solution at a nominal concentration of 100 
ppm.  
 
Install all internal, wetted accessories indicated on each vessel datasheet 434113 for testing. 
 
The test indicator solution shall be applied to all the interior surfaces of the vessel by some method other than 
using the actual spray devices and the test equipment. Internal surface of the vessel includes the top head. The 
vessel shall be inspected with a UV "black" light for complete coverage of the test indicator solution. More test 
indicator solution shall be re-applied to any areas that are not covered. 
 
Water flow shall be initiated at the flow rate and pressure required of the spray devices, as indicated on the 
approved shop drawings. Water shall flow for 30 seconds for static spray devices or one complete cycle for 
rotating devices, with the bottom outlet of the vessel open to drain. The 30-second bursts shall be repeated three 
(3) times per static spray device, or two (2) complete cycles for rotating devices.  
 
After the test has ended, allow vessel to drain. The interior of the vessel, including accessories, shall be completely 
inspected with a UV light to determine if ANY residual riboflavin remains after the test. If any residual riboflavin 
is detected, the spray devices shall be adjusted and/or modified, and the entire test repeated, including a fresh 
application of riboflavin. Once a satisfactory test has been completed, it shall be repeated to verify the successful 
results. The test shall be considered successful only when two (2) successful test runs have been completed in 
series.  
 
The Manufacturer shall document each and every test and shall include the time and date of each test, spray 
duration, number of sprays, modifications made, flowrate and pressure, and the areas that failed the visual 
inspection, in every test. Any spray device that was modified (drilled) during testing shall be re-passivated. 
 
3.2.6. 
Drainability Test 
 
The vessel shall be leveled prior to testing. Water shall be introduced into the vessel, up to the bottom tangent 
line with the bottom valve closed (or bottom port capped if the vessel is not specified with an integral bottom 
valve). The bottom outlet valve shall then be opened (or cap removed) to gravity drain the vessel. There shall be 
no puddles of water left on the bottom of the vessel greater than five (5) mm in diameter. If there are any puddles 
larger than five (5) mm in diameter, a thumb or soft rubber dowel is to be pushed into the center of the puddle, 
displacing the water. If water returns to the puddle, that area shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Owner. 
 
 
3.2.7. 
Surface Finish Test 
 
The Manufacturer shall make available an averaging profilometer calibrated with NIST traceable certifications, 
along with a sample that can be agreed to be “acceptable” (retain duplicate of original sample submitted) for 
establishing accuracy. Each vessel shall be visually inspected in its entirety with areas of concern noted with tape 
flags or post it notes. These points shall then be inspected using the following procedure: 
 
• 
The area to be inspected shall be cleaned using acetone and a clean, lint free rag. 
• 
The surface area being checked shall be recorded. 
• 
Readings shall be taken in three (3) directions, two (2) of which shall be 90° apart. 
• 
All readings shall be recorded. 
• 
A minimum of six (6) points shall be checked on the interior of each vessel with the top and bottom 
head each being checked. The exterior of the vessel shall also be inspected in this manner and with 
a minimum of four (4) points measured. Data points shall not be averaged together. Failure of two 
or more points may require additional testing. The Manufacturer shall provide access to all surfaces. 
The vessel will be evaluated to determine compliance with the specifications. The Manufacturer 
shall rework any areas not meeting the specification. 
• 
At completion of this testing a determination will be made as to any re-inspection of any vessels or 
the need for the Manufacturer to provide a representative at the job site to participate in Site 
Acceptance testing. 
 
3.2.8. 
Jacket Pressure Drop Test 
 
Connect vessel jacket to a recirculating pump system and fill with DI or owner-approved water. Recirculating 
pump should supply pressure approximately equal to the building jacket services supply pressure. After the jacket 
has been vented to remove air, circulate flow through the vessel jacket at the design flowrate. Measure and 
document jacket inlet pressure, outlet pressure and flowrate. After test is complete, vessel jacket should be 
completely drained and blown dry.  
 
3.2.9. 
Functional Test 
 
Movable and portable vessels shall be tested to verify that they safely resist overturn during movement of the 
vessel. Movement of the vessel shall be performed at the manufacturers shop.

The CIP skid shall be provided with the following components as a minimum: 
• 
One (1) Rinse/surge tank 
• 
Two (2) Wash/circulation tanks 
• 
CIP supply pump, variable frequency drive (VFD) compatible (VFD provided by others) 
• 
CIP supply heat exchanger 
• 
CIP return strainer 
• 
Air blow filter 
• 
Piping (w/single point connections for utilities where applicable) 
• 
Automated and manual valves 
• 
Instrumentation 
• 
Skid framing and support for all components. 
• 
Local Disconnect 
 
The CIP skid shall be capable of cleaning process equipment with integral air gaps (e.g., tanks), as well as closed 
pipe circuits.  Each unit shall be capable of operating in either a circulation (washes and circulated rinses) or once-
through mode (pre- and final rinses). 
 
 
2.1.1. 
Rinse and Wash Solutions 
 
Ambient WFI will be delivered directly from a WFI loop point-of-use valve (by others) to the rinse/surge tank on 
the skid, via a static spray ball.  At no time will water be returned to the rinse/surge tank, except during rinse/surge 
tank cleaning procedures (i.e., rinses will be to drain, via the CIP return piping on each skid, or circulated back to 
the wash/circulation tank). 
 
RO water will be delivered directly from a RO loop point-of-use valve (by others) to the wash/circulation tanks.  
Wash solutions shall be created in the wash/circulation tanks using a circulation loop that will return water directly 
to this tank via a j-tube in a separated top mounted nozzle with no spray ball.  Once created, wash solutions shall 
be delivered to the connected distribution system via the CIP supply pump and returned to the wash/circulation 
tank via a j-tube.  Circulated rinses shall be handled in the same manner, if pre-heating is required. 
 
Cleaning chemicals (detergents, caustics and acids) for the make-up of wash solutions will be supplied 
automatically to each system from the facility chemical distribution system operating at a constant pressure. Each 
CIP skid shall be capable of dosing the required volume of chemical solutions into the system in order to reach 
the desired conductivity.  The amount of chemical added for the wash solution should be based on a total volume 
set-point as determined during startup and commissioning.  The chemicals shall be supplied to the 
wash/circulation tank.  Water and chemicals shall be circulated on the skid via the wash/circulation tank until the 
desired (based on pre-programmed recipes) conductivity and/or time set point is reached, after which the solution 
shall be ready for delivery to the distribution system. 
 
A divert valve assembly shall be located downstream of all components on each CIP skid supply line and shall 
divert flow either directly to drain, to the distribution system or to the wash/circulation tank.  The CIP return line 
on each skid shall be configured with a divert valve assembly that will divert flow either directly to drain or into 
the wash/circulation tank via a top mounted nozzle with no spray device. 
 
2.1.2. 
Flow Control 
 
Each CIP skid will be required to provide different flow rates to the connected distribution system depending on 
the particular circuit piping or equipment to be cleaned.   
 
Flow control shall be accomplished using both a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) (by others) on the CIP supply 
pump and a Coriolis flow meter on pump discharge line for analog flow control.  The control system shall set the 
CIP supply pump to a pre-set speed for each cycle, via the VFD, based on the maximum flow rate plus 15% that 
will be required for that cycle.   
 
The flow meter shall be used to provide feedback to adjust the VFD and shall vary depending on a particular 
phase of the cycle (e.g., solution make-up and corresponding direct circulation to the wash/circulation tank, supply 
to the distribution system, and diversion to drain).   
 
2.1.3. 
Temperature Control 
 
Each CIP skid shall be capable of maintaining required solution and rinse temperatures listed on the data sheet 
for all required flow rates using a heat exchanger.  Reference the attached heat exchanger data sheet for each CIP 
skid for more information regarding each unit.  The steam supply line on each skid shall be trapped and provided 
with a drip leg. 
 
2.1.4. 
Level Control 
 
The level in the rinse and wash tanks need to be controlled. All tanks will need to control level by opening or 
closing the water point of use valve on the water loop.  Level will be monitored in the tanks to make sure an 
adequate level is maintained. 
   
 
2.1.5. 
Drainability 
 
Each CIP skid shall be completely drainable, requiring at a minimum an automated casing drain (true low-point 
of skid) and automatic drain valve on the supply pump suction line.  At the end of each circulation cycle, the 
valves are opened until the tank is empty (level = 0), plus additional time afforded for piping. 
 
2.1.6. 
Air Blows 
 
Each CIP skid shall be capable of providing air blows using clean compressed air as indicated in the Available 
Utilities, at the pressure indicated.  The air shall be supplied to the system via an automated diaphragm valve.  
Upstream components on the air line shall include, at a minimum, a check valve and a 0.2 micron filter. 
 
2.1.7. 
Return of CIP Solution to CIP Skid 
 
If it is determined that additional motive force is required to move the CIP solution from its intended destination 
back to the CIP skid, a separate CIP return pump will be installed near the equipment and general cleaning area.  
CIP return pumps will be provided by others. 
 
2.2. 
BASIC FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
